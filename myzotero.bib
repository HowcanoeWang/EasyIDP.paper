	abstract = {A reasonable plant type is an essential factor for improving canopy structure, ensuring a reasonable expansion of the leaf area index and obtaining a high-quality spatial distribution of light. It is of great significance in promoting effective selection of the ecological breeding index and production practices for maize. In this study, a method for calculating the phenotypic traits of the maize canopy in three-dimensional (3D) space was proposed, focusing on the problems existing in traditional measurement methods in maize morphological structure research, such as their complex procedures and relatively large error margins. Specifically, the whole maize plant was first scanned with a FastSCAN hand-held scanner to obtain 3D point cloud data for maize. Subsequently, the raw point clouds were simplified by the grid method, and the effect of noise on the quality of the point clouds in maize canopies was further denoised by bilateral filtering. In the last step, the 3D structure of the maize canopy was reconstructed. In accordance with the 3D reconstruction of the maize canopy, the phenotypic traits of the maize canopy, such as plant height, stem diameter and canopy breadth, were calculated by means of a fitting sphere and a fitting cylinder. Thereafter, multiple regression analysis was carried out, focusing on the calculated data and the actual measured data to verify the accuracy of the calculation method proposed in this study. The corresponding results showed that the calculated values of plant height, stem diameter and plant width based on 3D scanning were highly correlated with the actual measured data, and the determinant coefficients R2 were 0.9807, 0.8907 and 0.9562, respectively. In summary, the method proposed in this study can accurately measure the phenotypic traits of maize. Significantly, these research findings provide technical support for further research on the phenotypic traits of other crops and on variety breeding.},

	abstract = {Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) were used to phenotype growth trajectories of inbred maize populations under field conditions. Three recombinant inbred line populations were surveyed on a weekly basis collecting RGB images across two irrigation regimens (irrigated and non-irrigated/rain fed). Plant height, estimated by the 95 th percentile (P95) height from UAS generated 3D point clouds, exceeded 70\% correlation to manual ground truth measurements and 51\% of experimental variance was explained by genetics. The Weibull sigmoidal function accurately modeled plant growth (R 2 : \&gt;99\%; RMSE: \&lt; 4 cm) from P95 genetic means. The mean asymptote was strongly correlated (r 2 =0.66-0.77) with terminal plant height. Maximum absolute growth rates (mm d -1 ) were weakly correlated to height and flowering time. The average inflection point ranged from 57 to 60 days after sowing (DAS) and was correlated with flowering time (r 2 =0.45-0.68). Functional growth parameters (asymptote, inflection point, growth rate) alone identified 34 genetic loci, each explaining 3 to 15\% of total genetic variation. Plant height was estimated at one-day intervals to 85 DAS, identifying 58 unique temporal quantitative trait loci (QTL) locations. Genomic hotspots on chromosome 1 and 3 indicated chromosomal regions associated with functional growth trajectories influencing flowering time, growth rate, and terminal growth. Temporal QTL demonstrated unique dynamic expression patterns not observable previously, no QTL were significantly expressed throughout the entire growing season. UAS technologies improved phenotypic selection accuracy and permitted monitoring traits on a temporal scale previously infeasible using manual measurements, furthering understanding of crop development and biological trajectories.},

	abstract = {Accurate and high throughput extraction of crop phenotypic traits, as a crucial step of molecular breeding, is of great importance for yield increasing. However, automatic stem–leaf segmentation as a prerequisite of many precise phenotypic trait extractions is still a big challenge. Current works focus on the study of the 2-D image-based segmentation, which are sensitive to illumination and occlusion. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can obtain accurate 3-D information with its active laser scanning and strong penetration ability, which breaks through phenotyping from 2-D to 3-D. However, few researches have addressed the problem of the LiDAR-based stem–leaf segmentation. In this paper, we proposed a median normalized-vector growth (MNVG) algorithm, which can segment stem and leaf with four steps, i.e., preprocessing, stem growth, leaf growth, and postprocessing. The MNVG method was tested by 30 maize samples with different heights, compactness, leaf numbers, and densities from three growing stages. Moreover, phenotypic traits at leaf, stem, and individual levels were extracted with the truly segmented instances. The mean accuracy of segmentation at point level in terms of the recall, precision, F-score, and overall accuracy were 0.92, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.93, respectively. The accuracy of phenotypic trait extraction in leaf, stem, and individual levels ranged from 0.81 to 0.95, 0.64 to 0.97, and 0.96 to 1, respectively. To our knowledge, this paper proposed the first LiDAR-based stem–leaf segmentation and phenotypic trait extraction method in agriculture field, which may contribute to the study of LiDAR-based plant phonemics and precise agriculture.},

	abstract = {Background: An organism can be described by its observable features (phenotypes) and the genes and genomic information (genotypes) that cause these phenotypes. For many decades, researchers have tried to find relationships between genotypes and phenotypes and great strides have been made. However, improved methods and tools for discovering and visualizing these phenotypic relationships are still needed. The maize genetics and genomics database (MaizeGDB, www.maizegdb.org) provides an array of useful resources for diverse data types including thousands of images related to mutant phenotypes in Zea mays ssp. mays (maize). To integrate mutant phenotype images with genomics information, we implemented and enhanced the web-based software package BioDIG (Biological Database of Images and Genomes). Findings: We developed a genotype-phenotype database for maize called MaizeDIG. MaizeDIG has several enhancements over the original BioDIG package. MaizeDIG which supports multiple reference genome assemblies, is seamlessly integrated with genome browsers to accommodate custom tracks showing tagged mutant phenotypes images in their genomic context, and allows for custom tagging of images to highlight the phenotype. This is accomplished through an updated interface allowing users to create image-to-gene links and is accessible via the image search tool. Conclusions: We have created a user-friendly and extensible web-based resource called MaizeDIG. MaizeDIG is preloaded with 2,396 images that are available on genome browsers for ten different maize reference genomes. Approximately 90 images of classically defined maize genes have been manually annotated. MaizeDIG is available at (http://maizedig.maizegdb.org/). The code is free and open source and can be found at (https://github.com/Maize-Genetics-and-Genomics-Database/maizedig)},

Detailed phenotypes of individual plants can guide the optimization of shoot architecture for plant breeding and are useful to analyze the morphological differences in response to environments for crop cultivation. Accordingly, high-throughput phenotyping technologies for individual plants grown in field conditions are urgently needed, and MVS-Pheno, a portable and low-cost phenotyping platform for individual plants, was developed. The platform is composed of four major components: a semiautomatic multiview stereo (MVS) image acquisition device, a data acquisition console, data processing and phenotype extraction software for maize shoots, and a data management system. The platform’s device is detachable and adjustable according to the size of the target shoot. Image sequences for each maize shoot can be captured within 60-120 seconds, yielding 3D point clouds of shoots are reconstructed using MVS-based commercial software, and the phenotypic traits at the organ and individual plant levels are then extracted by the software. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the extracted and manually measured plant height, leaf width, and leaf area values are 0.99, 0.87, and 0.93, respectively. A data management system has also been developed to store and manage the acquired raw data, reconstructed point clouds, agronomic information, and resulting phenotypic traits. The platform offers an optional solution for high-throughput phenotyping of field-grown plants, which is especially useful for large populations or experiments across many different ecological regions.},

	abstract = {High resolution RGB imagery collected using a UAV and a handheld camera was used with structure from motion to reconstruct 3D canopies of small groups of corn plants. A methodology for the automated extraction of phenotypic characteristics of individual plants is presented based on these 3D reconstructed canopies. Such information can enhance the evaluation of crop traits and provide accurate and frequent statistics for in-season assessment of their changes with growth stage. Industries that target yield optimization and crop hybrid production can benefit greatly from this approach. The use of 3D models provides elevated information content, when compared to alternative planar methods, mainly due to the alleviation of leaf occlusions. High resolution images of corn stalks are collected and used to obtain 3D models for individual plants. Based on those extracted 3D point clouds, the calculation of phenotypic characteristics are obtained, such as the number of plants in an area, the Leaf Area Index (LAI), the individual and average plant height, the individual leaf length, the location and the angles of leaves with respect to the stem. An experimental validation using both artificial corn plants emulating real world scenarios and real corn plants in different growth stages, supports the accuracy of the proposed methodology. Our experiments conclude that phenotypic characteristics of individual plants can be extracted automatically with high accuracy based on a 3D model. The results include the individual plant segmentation and counting from a given 3D reconstructed field scene with 88.1\% accuracy, the Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation with 92.5\% accuracy, the individual plant height computation with 89.2\% accuracy, the leaf length extraction with 74.8\% accuracy, the measurement of angles between leaves and stems, and the distance between the leaves of the same plant. We interpret the last two variables qualitatively to show that the method can show the trend of the angles to change with respect to the leaf position on the stem as the crops grow.},

	abstract = {The continuously growing need for increasing the production of food and reducing the degradation of water supplies, has led to the development of several precision agriculture systems over the past decade so as to meet the needs of modern societies. The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2\% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves.},

	abstract = {Though some two-dimensional (2D) machine vision–based systems for early-growth-stage corn plant sensing exist, some of their shortcomings are difficult to overcome. The greatest challenge comes from separating individual corn plants with overlapped plant canopies. With 2D machine vision, variation in outdoor lighting conditions and weeds in the background also pose difficulties in corn plant identification. Adding the depth dimension has the potential to improve the performance of such a sensing system. A new corn plant sensing system using a real-time stereo vision system was investigated in this research. Top-view depth images of corn plant canopy were acquired. By processing the depth images, the algorithm effectively updated the plant skeleton structures and finally recognized individual corn plants and detected their center positions. The stereo vision system was tested over corn plants of V2–V3 growth stages in both laboratory and field conditions. Experimental results showed that the stereo vision system was capable of detecting both separated and overlapped corn plants. During the field test, 96.7p of the corn plants were correctly detected, and plant center positions were estimated with maximum distance errors of 5 and 1 cm for 74.6p and 62.3p of detections, respectively. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Accurate and high-throughput determination of plant morphological traits is essential for phenotyping studies. Nowadays, there are many approaches to acquire high-quality three-dimensional (3D) point clouds of plants. However, it is difficult to estimate phenotyping parameters accurately of the whole growth stages of maize plants using these 3D point clouds. In this paper, an accurate skeleton extraction approach was proposed to bridge the gap between 3D point cloud and phenotyping traits estimation of maize plants. The algorithm first uses point cloud clustering and color difference denoising to reduce the noise of the input point clouds. Next, the Laplacian contraction algorithm is applied to shrink the points. Then the key points representing the skeleton of the plant are selected through adaptive sampling, and neighboring points are connected to form a plant skeleton composed of semantic organs. Finally, deviation skeleton points to the input point cloud are calibrated by building a step forward local coordinate along the tangent direction of the original points. The proposed approach successfully generates accurately extracted skeleton from 3D point cloud and helps to estimate phenotyping parameters with high precision of maize plants. Experimental verification of the skeleton extraction process, tested using three cultivars and different growth stages maize, demonstrates that the extracted matches the input point cloud well. Compared with 3D digitizing data-derived morphological parameters, the NRMSE of leaf length, leaf inclination angle, leaf top length, leaf azimuthal angle, leaf growth height, and plant height, estimated using the extracted plant skeleton, are 5.27, 8.37, 5.12, 4.42, 1.53, and 0.83\%, respectively, which could meet the needs of phenotyping analysis. The time required to process a single maize plant is below 100 s. The proposed approach may play an important role in further maize research and applications, such as genotype-to-phenotype study, geometric reconstruction, functional structural maize modeling, and dynamic growth animation.},

	abstract = {A 3D architectural and process-based model of maize development was implemented on the basis of the L-system software Graphtal, interfaced with physical models computing microclimate distributed on the 3D canopy structure. In a first step, we incorporated in the software Graphtal additional functions that enable bi-directional communication with external modules. A simple model for distributed photosynthetically active radiation and the model for apex temperature by Cellier et al .( Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 63: 35‐54, 1993) were interfaced with Graphtal. In a second step we developed a L-system model for maize, where production rules for growth and development of organs are based on the current state of knowledge of maize development as a function of temperature. Visual representation of the plant is based on the geometrical model of leaf shape by Pre! vot, Aries and Monestiez (Agronomie 11: 491‐503, 1991). Finally, various data sets were used to evaluate the physiological aspects and the geometrical representation. It is concluded that environmental L-systems are a convenient tool to integrate biophysical processes from organ to canopy level, and provide a framework to model growth of individual plants in relation to local conditions and ability to forage for resources. However, progress is needed to improve both the knowledge of physiological processes at the organ level and the calculation of physical environmental parameters; some directions for future research are proposed. \# 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the era of high-throughput visual plant phenotyping, it is crucial to design fully automated and flexible workflows able to derive quantitative traits from plant images. Over the last years, several software supports the extraction of architectural features of shoot systems. Yet currently no end-to-end systems are able to extract both 3D shoot topology and geometry of plants automatically from images on large datasets and a large range of species. In particular, these software essentially deal with dicotyledons, whose architecture is comparatively easier to analyze than monocotyledons. To tackle these challenges, we designed the Phenomenal software featured with: (i) a completely automatic workflow system including data import, reconstruction of 3D plant architecture for a range of species and quantitative measurements on the reconstructed plants; (ii) an open source library for the development and comparison of new algorithms to perform 3D shoot reconstruction and (iii) an integration framework to couple workflow outputs with existing models towards model-assisted phenotyping. Phenomenal analyzes a large variety of data sets and species from images of high-throughput phenotyping platform experiments to published data obtained in different conditions and provided in a different format. Phenomenal has been validated both on manual measurements and synthetic data simulated by 3D models. It has been also tested on other published datasets to reproduce a published semi-automatic reconstruction workflow in an automatic way.

	abstract = {High-throughput phenotyping technologies have become an increasingly important topic of crop science in recent years. Various sensors and data acquisition approaches have been applied to acquire the phenotyping traits. It is quite confusing for crop phenotyping researchers to determine an appropriate way for their application. In this study, three representative three-dimensional (3D) data acquisition approaches, including 3D laser scanning, multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, and 3D digitizing, were evaluated for maize plant phenotyping in multi growth stages. Phenotyping traits accuracy, post-processing difficulty, device cost, data acquisition efficiency, and automation were considered during the evaluation process. 3D scanning provided satisfactory point clouds for medium and high maize plants with acceptable efficiency, while the results were not satisfactory for small maize plants. The equipment used in 3D scanning is expensive, but is highly automatic. MVS reconstruction provided satisfactory point clouds for small and medium plants, and point deviations were observed in upper parts of higher plants. MVS data acquisition, using low-cost cameras, exhibited the highest efficiency among the three evaluated approaches. The one-by-one pipeline data acquisition pattern allows the use of MVS high-throughput in further phenotyping platforms. Undoubtedly, enhancement of point cloud processing technologies is required to improve the extracted phenotyping traits accuracy for both 3D scanning and MVS reconstruction. Finally, 3D digitizing was time-consuming and labor intensive. However, it does not depend on any post-processing algorithms to extract phenotyping parameters and reliable phenotyping traits could be derived. The promising accuracy of 3D digitizing is a better verification choice for other 3D phenotyping approaches. Our study provides clear reference about phenotyping data acquisition of maize plants, especially for the affordable and portable field phenotyping platforms to be developed.},

              Background and Aims
              Light interception is closely related to canopy architecture. Few studies based on multi-view photography have been conducted in a field environment, particularly studies that link 3D plant architecture with a radiation model to quantify the dynamic canopy light interception. In this study, we combined realistic 3D plant architecture with a radiation model to quantify and evaluate the effect of differences in planting patterns and row orientations on canopy light interception.
            
            
              Methods
              The three-dimensional architecture of maize and soybean plants were reconstructed for sole crops and intercrops based on multi-view images obtained at five growth dates in the field. We evaluated the accuracy of the calculated leaf length, maximum leaf width, plant height and leaf area according to the measured data. The light distribution within the 3D plant canopy was calculated with a 3D radiation model. Finally, we evaluated canopy light interception in different row orientations.
            
            
              Key Results
              There was good agreement between the measured and calculated phenotypic traits, with an R2\&gt;0.97. The light distribution was more uniform for intercropped maize and more concentrated for sole maize. At the maize silking stage, 85\% of radiation was intercepted by approximately 55\% of the upper canopy region for maize and by approximately 33\% of the upper canopy region for soybean. There was no significant difference in daily light interception between the different row orientations for the entire intercropping and sole systems. However, for intercropped maize, near east-west orientations showed approximately 19\% higher daily light interception than near south-north orientations. For intercropped soybean, daily light interception showed the opposite trend. It was approximately 49\% higher for near south-north orientations than for near east-west orientations.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The accurate reconstruction of 3D plants grown in the field based on multi-view images provides the possibility for high-throughput 3D phenotyping in the field and allows a better understanding of the relationship between canopy architecture and the light environment.},

	abstract = {Using 3D sensing for plant phenotyping has risen within the last years. This review provides an overview on 3D traits for the demands of plant phenotyping considering different measuring techniques, derived traits and use-cases of biological applications. A comparison between a high resolution 3D measuring device and an established measuring tool, the leaf meter, is shown to categorize the possible measurement accuracy. Furthermore, different measuring techniques such as laser triangulation, structure from motion, time-of-flight, terrestrial laser scanning or structured light approaches enable the assessment of plant traits such as leaf width and length, plant size, volume and development on plant and organ level. The introduced traits were shown with respect to the measured plant types, the used measuring technique and the link to their biological use case. These were trait and growth analysis for measurements over time as well as more complex investigation on water budget, drought responses and QTL (quantitative trait loci) analysis. The used processing pipelines were generalized in a 3D point cloud processing workflow showing the single processing steps to derive plant parameters on plant level, on organ level using machine learning or over time using time series measurements. Finally the next step in plant sensing, the fusion of different sensor types namely 3D and spectral measurements is introduced by an example on sugar beet. This multi-dimensional plant model is the key to model the influence of geometry on radiometric measurements and to correct it. This publication depicts the state of the art for 3D measuring of plant traits as they were used in plant phenotyping regarding how the data is acquired, how this data is processed and what kind of traits is measured at the single plant, the miniplot, the experimental field and the open field scale. Future research will focus on highly resolved point clouds on the experimental and field scale as well as on the automated trait extraction of organ traits to track organ development at these scales.},

	abstract = {Phenotyping of crops is important due to increasing pressure on food production. Therefore, an accurate estimation of biomass during the growing season can be important to optimize the yield. The potential of data acquisition by UAV-LiDAR to estimate fresh biomass and crop height was investigated for three different crops (potato, sugar beet, and winter wheat) grown in Wageningen (The Netherlands) from June to August 2018. Biomass was estimated using the 3DPI algorithm, while crop height was estimated using the mean height of a variable number of highest points for each m2. The 3DPI algorithm proved to estimate biomass well for sugar beet (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 17.47 g/m2) and winter wheat (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 13.94 g/m2). Also, the height estimates worked well for sugar beet (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 7.4 cm) and wheat (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 3.4 cm). However, for potato both plant height (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 12 cm) and biomass estimation (R2 = 0.24, RMSE = 22.09 g/m2), it proved to be less reliable due to the complex canopy structure and the ridges on which potatoes are grown. In general, for accurate biomass and crop height estimates using those algorithms, the flight conditions (altitude, speed, location of flight lines) should be comparable to the settings for which the models are calibrated since changing conditions do influence the estimated biomass and crop height strongly.},

	abstract = {Image-based plant phenotyping has become a promising method for high-throughput measurement of plant traits in breeding programs. Plant geometric features that are essential for understanding plant growth can be obtained from the point cloud built using three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of plant imagery data. A key task in the data processing pipeline is the automated and accurate segmentation of individual plants. Machine learning is a promising approach due to its strong ability in the extraction of details from images and has been successfully applied in plant leaf segmentation from two-dimensional (2D) images. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the performance of three machine learning methods, i.e. boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-means clustering, in the segmentation of non-overlapped and overlapped soybean plants at early growth stages using 3D point cloud. Images of 75 soybean plants at two growth stages in a greenhouse were collected using an image-based high-throughput phenotyping platform and were used to develop 3D point cloud using the Structure from Motion (SfM) method. Plant features including position (coordinate x, y, and z), and color (Red, Green, Blue, hue, saturation and Triangular Greenness Index) were used for background removal and the separation of non-overlapped plants. A Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor was used for the separation of overlapped plants. The percentage of mismatched points between manual and automated segmentation was calculated and results showed that K-means clustering had the least mean error rates (0.36\% and 0.20\%) for the background removal and the non-overlapped plant separation. The least mean error rate for the separation of overlapped plants was 2.57\% using SVM with labeled HOG descriptor. The developed image segmentation pipeline was evaluated in a case study where 69 plants at different growth stages were continuously monitored. Results showed that it took three minutes on average for completing all procedures in the pipeline and the extracted features (i.e. height and shooting area) were able to quantify the plant growth.},

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology can potentially overcome these difficulties by providing high quality data. However, there are difficulties in automatically classifying and segmenting components of interest. Deep learning can extract complex features, but it is mostly used with images. Here, we propose a voxel-based convolutional neural network (VCNN) for maize stem and leaf classification and segmentation. Maize plants at three different growth stages were scanned with a terrestrial LiDAR and the voxelized LiDAR data were used as inputs. A total of 3000 individual plants (22 004 leaves and 3000 stems) were prepared for training through data augmentation, and 103 maize plants were used to evaluate the accuracy of classification and segmentation at both instance and point levels. The VCNN was compared with traditional clustering methods ( \$K\$ -means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise), a geometry-based segmentation method, and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (PointNet and PointNet++). The results showed that: 1) at the instance level, the mean accuracy of classification and segmentation (F-score) were 1.00 and 0.96, respectively; 2) at the point level, the mean accuracy of classification and segmentation (F-score) were 0.91 and 0.89, respectively; 3) the VCNN method outperformed traditional clustering methods; and 4) the VCNN was on par with PointNet and PointNet++ in classification, and performed the best in segmentation. The proposed method demonstrated LiDAR’s ability to separate structural components for crop phenotyping using deep learning, which can be useful for other fields.},

Working on model plants (such as Arabidopsis), combined with remarkable advances in genotyping, has revolutionized our understanding of biology but has accelerated the need for precision and automation in phenotyping, favoring approaches that provide quantifiable phenotypic information that could be better used to link and find associations in the genotype [4]. While early on, the collection of phenotypes was manual, currently noninvasive, imaging-based methods are increasingly being utilized [5], [6].

However, the rapid segmentation and grading of broccoli head remains difficult in many parts of the world due to low equipment development level. In this paper, we combined an advanced computer vision technique with a deep learning architecture to allow the acquisition of real-time and accurate information about broccoli head. By constructing a private image dataset with hundreds of broccoli-head images (acquired using a selfdeveloped imaging system) under controlled conditions, a deep convolutional neural network named "Improved ResNet" was trained to extract the broccoli pixels from the background. Then, a yield estimation model was built based on the number of extracted pixels and the corresponding pixel weight value. Additionally, the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSOA) and the Otsu method were applied to grade the quality of each broccoli head according to our new standard. The trained model achieved an Accuracy of 0.896 on the test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images with different light intensities or with some noise, the model still achieved satisfactory results. Overall, our approach of training a deep learning model using low-cost imaging devices represents a means to improve broccoli breeding and vegetable trade.},

We present an approach which models the mesh directly, predicting mesh vertices and faces sequentially using a Transformer-based architecture. Our model can condition on a range of inputs, including object classes, voxels, and images, and because the model is probabilistic it can produce samples that capture uncertainty in ambiguous scenarios. We show that the model is capable of producing high-quality, usable meshes, and establish log-likelihood benchmarks for the mesh-modelling task. We also evaluate the conditional models on surface reconstruction metrics against alternative methods, and demonstrate competitive performance despite not training directly on this task.},

An automatic data processing pipeline was developed to process point clouds of sugar beet including preprocessing, coordinates correction, filtering and segmentation of point cloud of individual plant. Phenotypic traits were also automatically extracted regarding plant height, maximum canopy area, convex hull volume, total leaf area and individual leaf length. Total leaf area and convex hull volume were adopted to explore the relationship with biomass. The results showed that high correlations between measured and estimated values with R2 {\textgreater} 0.8.

	abstract = {Abstract Progress in remote sensing and robotic technologies decreases the hardware costs of phenotyping. Here, we first review cost-effective imaging devices and environmental sensors, and present a trade-off between investment and manpower costs. We then discuss the structure of costs in various real-world scenarios. Hand-held low-cost sensors are suitable for quick and infrequent plant diagnostic measurements. In experiments for genetic or agronomic analyses, (i) major costs arise from plant handling and manpower; (ii) the total costs per plant/microplot are similar in robotized platform or field experiments with drones, hand-held or robotized ground vehicles; (iii) the cost of vehicles carrying sensors represents only 5–26\% of the total costs. These conclusions depend on the context, in particular for labor cost, the quantitative demand of phenotyping and the number of days available for phenotypic measurements due to climatic constraints. Data analysis represents 10–20\% of total cost if pipelines have already been developed. A trade-off exists between the initial high cost of pipeline development and labor cost of manual operations. Overall, depending on the context and objsectives, “cost-effective” phenotyping may involve either low investment (“affordable phenotyping”), or initial high investments in sensors, vehicles and pipelines that result in higher quality and lower operational costs.},

	abstract = {Plant breeding is the key to genetic improvement and increased crop yield. Breeding projects require the determination of plant phenotypes (i.e., phenotyping), a task that becomes tedious and biased when performed manually. Thus, to speed-up and improve breeding projects, novel autonomous phenotyping methods must be developed. Among the currently available methods, three-dimensional (3-D) plant modeling offers a high-resolution description of plant morphology and hence a detailed analysis of plant growth. However, advanced organ-level scale analysis of 3-D data is a complex process that requires preliminary segmentation of the 3-D point cloud into leaf- and stem-related points. Despite their obvious importance, only a few segmentation models have been reported, and many studies still perform this task manually. This paper presents a novel data-driven segmentation model as a basis for organ-level plant analysis. It shows that a point-wise computation of first- and second-order tensors is sufficient to characterize the data, without the need for pre-defined shape assumptions and constraints. Application of the model to a variety of species at different growth stages gave accurate segmentation results regardless of the species morphology and the plant growth stage. The derived information provides an organ-level phenotyping ability, and the paper shows how this ability remains accurate for various geometries and growth stages, even when the model is applied to noisy data or when the reconstruction is incomplete. An accurate, nondestructive, and autonomous organ-level phenotyping pipeline, such as the one described here, will find application for trait selection processes in breeding programs. In addition, the short processing time facilitate the use of our pipeline for precision agriculture field applications.},

	abstract = {Plant breeding programs and a wide range of plant science applications would greatly benefit from the development of in-field high throughput phenotyping technologies. In this study, a terrestrial LiDAR-based high throughput phenotyping system was developed. A 2D LiDAR was applied to scan plants from overhead in the field, and an RTK-GPS was used to provide spatial coordinates. Precise 3D models of scanned plants were reconstructed based on the LiDAR and RTK-GPS data. The ground plane of the 3D model was separated by RANSAC algorithm and a Euclidean clustering algorithm was applied to remove noise generated by weeds. After that, clean 3D surface models of cotton plants were obtained, from which three plot-level morphologic traits including canopy height, projected canopy area, and plant volume were derived. Canopy height ranging from 85th percentile to the maximum height were computed based on the histogram of the z coordinate for all measured points; projected canopy area was derived by projecting all points on a ground plane; and a Trapezoidal rule based algorithm was proposed to estimate plant volume. Results of validation experiments showed good agreement between LiDAR measurements and manual measurements for maximum canopy height, projected canopy area, and plant volume, with R2-values of 0.97, 0.97, and 0.98, respectively. The developed system was used to scan the whole field repeatedly over the period from 43 to 109 days after planting. Growth trends and growth rate curves for all three derived morphologic traits were established over the monitoring period for each cultivar. Overall, four different cultivars showed similar growth trends and growth rate patterns. Each cultivar continued to grow until {\textasciitilde}88 days after planting, and from then on varied little. However, the actual values were cultivar specific. Correlation analysis between morphologic traits and final yield was conducted over the monitoring period. When considering each cultivar individually, the three traits showed the best correlations with final yield during the period between around 67 and 109 days after planting, with maximum R2-values of up to 0.84, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. The developed system demonstrated relatively high throughput data collection and analysis.},

	abstract = {The segmentation of crop organs from 3D laser point clouds is an important prerequisite work of crop phenotypic parameters in non-destructive measurement. This paper respectively selected the 3D point cloud data of the rapeseed plant with leaf stage and pod stage as the research materials. A novel normal vector-based method for segmentation of the 3D point cloud is presented. First, a 3D scanner, HandyScan 300, was used to obtain 3D point cloud data. Second, using the voxel-based grid method, the original point cloud data were down-sampled at the premise of keeping the shape of point cloud unchanged. Third, according to the characteristics of the point cloud, the two conditions of the normal vector difference and the Euclidean distance between each point could be merged into two necessary conditions of the current class. Finally, the nearest point was searched with a set of labeled point cloud growth and through each point cloud of European radius until the collection of point cloud and the adjacent candidate was in accordance with the current conditions of the finished classification process. Results showed that the angle difference threshold of the normal vector was [0.91, 0.95]. The segmentation effect of the point cloud data of the leaves of the rapeseed plant was the best, which avoided the problem of misclassification and the appearance of over-segmentation. The angle difference threshold of the normal vector was [0.88, 0.91]. The segmentation effect of the point cloud data of the pod of the rapeseed plant was the best, and the accuracy rate reached 97\%. Therefore, the validity and feasibility of the method was verified. Accurate segmentation of the plant organ is another foundation for the nondestructive measurement of the phenotypic parameters in the later stage.},

Close-up laser scanning is an established method to acquire 3D plant shapes in real time with high detail, but it is stationary and has high investment costs. 3D reconstruction from images using structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) is a flexible cost-effective method, but requires post-processing procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential measuring accuracy of an SfM- and MVS-based photogrammetric method for the task of organ-level plant phenotyping. For this, reference data are provided by a high-accuracy close-up laser scanner. Using both methods, point clouds of several tomato plants were reconstructed at six following days. The parameters leaf area, main stem height and convex hull of the complete plant were extracted from the 3D point clouds and compared to the reference data regarding accuracy and correlation. These parameters were chosen regarding the demands of current phenotyping scenarios. The study shows that the photogrammetric approach is highly suitable for the presented monitoring scenario, yielding high correlations to the reference measurements. This cost-effective 3D reconstruction method depicts an alternative to an expensive laser scanner in the studied scenarios with potential for automated procedures.},

A depth camera was used to acquire images of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), an important grain, forage, and bioenergy crop, at multiple developmental time points from a greenhouse-grown recombinant inbred line population. A semiautomated software pipeline was developed and used to generate segmented, 3D plant reconstructions from the images. Automated measurements made from 3D plant reconstructions identified quantitative trait loci for standard measures of shoot architecture, such as shoot height, leaf angle, and leaf length, and for novel composite traits, such as shoot compactness. The phenotypic variability associated with some of the quantitative trait loci displayed differences in temporal prevalence; for example, alleles closely linked with the sorghum Dwarf3 gene, an auxin transporter and pleiotropic regulator of both leaf inclination angle and shoot height, influence leaf angle prior to an effect on shoot height. Furthermore, variability in composite phenotypes that measure overall shoot architecture, such as shoot compactness, is regulated by loci underlying component phenotypes like leaf angle. As such, depth imaging is an economical and rapid method to acquire shoot architecture phenotypes in agriculturally important plants like sorghum to study the genetic basis of complex traits.},

The spatial variation of direct and diffuse incident light in the glasshouse (up to 24\%) was correctly predicted at the single-plant scale. Light interception largely varied between maize lines that differed in leaf angles (nearly stable between experiments) and area (highly variable between experiments). Estimated RUEs varied between maize lines, but were similar in two experiments with contrasting incident light. They closely correlated with measured gas exchanges.

With access to 3D models of real plants it is possible to acquire detailed morphological and gross developmental data that can be used to study their ecophysiology, leading to an increase in crop yield and stability across hostile and changing environments. Here we review approaches to the reconstruction of 3D models of plant shoots from image data, consider current applications in plant and crop science, and identify remaining challenges.

	abstract = {In maize, silks are hundreds of filaments that simultaneously emerge from the ear for collecting pollen over a period of 1–7 days, which largely determines grain number especially under water deficit. Silk growth is a major trait for drought tolerance in maize, but its phenotyping is difficult at throughputs needed for genetic analyses. We have developed a reproducible pipeline that follows ear and silk growths every day for hundreds of plants, based on an ear detection algorithm that drives a robotized camera for obtaining detailed images of ears and silks. We first select, among 12 whole-plant side views, those best suited for detecting ear position. Images are segmented, the stem pixels are labelled and the ear position is identified based on changes in width along the stem. A mobile camera is then automatically positioned in real time at 30 cm from the ear, for a detailed picture in which silks are identified based on texture and colour. This allows analysis of the time course of ear and silk growths of thousands of plants. The pipeline was tested on a panel of 60 maize hybrids in the PHENOARCH phenotyping platform. Over 360 plants, ear position was correctly estimated in 86\% of cases, before it could be visually assessed. Silk growth rate, estimated on all plants, decreased with time consistent with literature. The pipeline allowed clear identification of the effects of genotypes and water deficit on the rate and duration of silk growth. The pipeline presented here, which combines computer vision, machine learning and robotics, provides a powerful tool for large-scale genetic analyses of the control of reproductive growth to changes in environmental conditions in a non-invasive and automatized way. It is available as Open Source software in the OpenAlea platform.},

	abstract = {Abstract A low-cost three-dimensional (3D) plant reconstruction and morphological traits characterization system was developed. Corn plant seedlings were used as research objects for development and validation of the 3D reconstruction and point cloud data analysis algorithms. In this application, precise alignment of multiple 3D views generated by a 3D time-of-flight (ToF) sensor is critical to the 3D reconstruction of a plant. Previous research indicated that there is strong need for high-throughput, high-accuracy, and low-cost 3D plant reconstruction and trait characterization phenotyping systems. This research produced a 3D reconstruction system for indoor plant phenotyping by innovatively integrating a low-cost 2D camera, a low-cost 3D ToF camera, and a chessboard pattern beacon array to track the position and attitude of the 3D ToF sensor and, thus, accomplished precise 3D point cloud registration over multiple views. Specifically, algorithms for beacon target detection, camera pose tracking, and spatial relationship calibration between 2D and 3D cameras were developed for such a low-cost but high-performance 3D reconstruction solution. A plant analysis algorithm in a 3D space was developed to extract the morphological trait parameters of the plants by analyzing their 3D point cloud data. The phenotypical data obtained by this novel and low-cost 3D reconstruction based phenotyping system were validated by the experimental data generated by instrument and manual measurement. The results demonstrated that the developed phenotyping system has achieved promising measurement accuracy, fast processing speed while offering a low hardware cost, lending itself to a practical means of acquiring detailed 3D morphological traits for automated indoor plant phenotyping.},

	abstract = {Sensing advances in plant phenotyping are of vital importance in basic and applied plant research. Plant phenotyping enables the modeling of complex shapes, which is useful, for example, in decision-making for agronomic management. In this sense, 3D processing algorithms for plant modeling is expanding rapidly with the emergence of new sensors and techniques designed to morphologically characterize. However, there are still some technical aspects to be improved, such as an accurate reconstruction of end-details. This study adapted low-cost techniques, Structure from Motion (SfM) and MultiView Stereo (MVS), to create 3D models for reconstructing plants of three weed species with contrasting shape and plant structures. Plant reconstruction was developed by applying SfM algorithms to an input set of digital images acquired sequentially following a track that was concentric and equidistant with respect to the plant axis and using three different angles, from a perpendicular to top view, which guaranteed the necessary overlap between images to obtain high precision 3D models. With this information, a dense point cloud was created using MVS, from which a 3D polygon mesh representing every plants’ shape and geometry was generated. These 3D models were validated with ground truth values (e.g., plant height, leaf area (LA) and plant dry biomass) using regression methods. The results showed, in general, a good consistency in the correlation equations between the estimated values in the models and the actual values measured in the weed plants. Indeed, 3D modeling using SfM algorithms proved to be a valuable methodology for weed phenotyping, since it accurately estimated the actual values of plant height and LA. Additionally, image processing using the SfM method was relatively fast. Consequently, our results indicate the potential of this budget system for plant reconstruction at high detail, which may be usable in several scenarios, including outdoor conditions. Future research should address other issues, such as the time-cost relationship and the need for detail in the different approaches.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims:Global agriculture is facing the challenge of a phenotyping bottleneck due to large-scale screening/breeding experiments with improved breeds. Phenotypic analysis with high-throughput, high-accuracy and low-cost technologies has therefore become urgent. Recent advances in image-based 3D reconstruction offer the opportunity of high-throughput phenotyping. The main aim of this study was to quantify and evaluate the canopy structure of plant populations in two and three dimensions based on the multi-view stereo (MVS) approach, and to monitor plant growth and development from seedling stage to fruiting stage. Methods:Multi-view images of flat-leaf cucumber, small-leaf pepper and curly-leaf eggplant were obtained by moving a camera around the plant canopy. Three-dimensional point clouds were reconstructed from images based on the MVS approach and were then converted into surfaces with triangular facets. Phenotypic parameters, including leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, plant height and maximum canopy width, were calculated from reconstructed surfaces. Accurate evaluation in 2D and 3D for individual leaves was performed by comparing reconstructed phenotypic parameters with referenced values and by calculating the Hausdorff distance, i.e. the mean distance between two surfaces. Key Results:Our analysis demonstrates that there were good agreements in leaf parameters between referenced and estimated values. A high level of overlap was also found between surfaces of image-based reconstructions and laser scanning. Accuracy of 3D reconstruction of curly-leaf plants was relatively lower than that of flat-leaf plants. Plant height of three plants and maximum canopy width of cucumber and pepper showed an increasing trend during the 70 d after transplanting. Maximum canopy width of eggplants reached its peak at the 40th day after transplanting. The larger leaf phenotypic parameters of cucumber were mostly found at the middle-upper leaf position. Conclusions:High-accuracy 3D evaluation of reconstruction quality indicated that dynamic capture of the 3D canopy based on the MVS approach can be potentially used in 3D phenotyping for applications in breeding and field management.},

	abstract = {Abstract It remains challenging to estimate a crop’s leaf area profile accurately and automatically. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers a potential solution, since it has a small footprint and can be used to rapidly and accurately resolve the canopy’s 3D structure. To improve the accuracy of vertical leaf area profile estimation, we selected point clouds from three corn plants scanned in two TLS experiments and used an improved voxel-based leaf area profile estimation method based on Wilson’s contact-frequency theory. The improvement has three aspects: First, it separates corn leaf points from stalk points using the difference-of-normals (DoN) method, which is commonly used to separate different surfaces of manmade objects such as tables or walls. The DoN method captures the geometrical difference between corn leaves and stalks. Second, it determines the optimal voxel size based on the calculated contact frequency. Third, it applies Wilson’s voxel-based contact-frequency method to the LiDAR point clouds. Comparing the estimated and measured leaf area profiles showed that separating leaf and stalk points improved the leaf area accuracy, which depended on the voxel size. The optimal voxel sizes were 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm and 5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm, respectively, in the two study years based on irradiation of the corn plant with a single laser beam. The estimated vertical and cumulative leaf area profiles agreed well with the measured profiles; mean absolute errors for the samples ranged from 15.7 to 18.9\%.},

Automated approaches for image capture and analysis have allowed for substantial increases in the throughput of quantitative growth trait measurements compared to manual assessments. Recent work has focused on adopting computer vision and machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of automated plant phenotyping. Here we present PS-Plant, a low-cost and portable 3D plant phenotyping platform based on an imaging technique novel to plant phenotyping called photometric stereo (PS). Results: We calibrated PS-Plant to track the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana throughout the day-night (diel) cycle and investigated growth architecture under a variety of conditions to illustrate the dramatic effect of the environment on plant phenotype. We developed bespoke computer vision algorithms and assessed available deep neural network architectures to automate the segmentation of rosettes and individual leaves, and extract basic and more advanced traits from PS-derived data, including the tracking of 3D plant growth and diel leaf hyponastic movement. Furthermore, we have produced the first PS training data set, which includes 221 manually annotated Arabidopsis rosettes that were used for training and data analysis (1768 images in total). A full protocol is provided, including all software components and an additional test data set. Conclusions: PS-Plant is a powerful new phenotyping tool for plant research that provides robust data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The system is well-suited for small and large-scale research and will help to accelerate bridging of the phenotype-to-genotype gap.},

	abstract = {Flood has an important effect on plant growth by affecting their physiologic and biochemical properties. Soybean is one of the main cultivated crops in the world and the United States is one of the largest soybean producers. However, soybean plant is sensitive to flood stress that may cause slow growth, low yield, small crop production and result in significant economic loss. Therefore, it is critical to develop soybean cultivars that are tolerant to flood. One of the current bottlenecks in developing new crop cultivars is slow and inaccurate plant phenotyping that limits the genetic gain. This study aimed to develop a low-cost 3D imaging system to quantify the variation in the growth and biomass of soybean due to flood at its early growth stages. Two cultivars of soybeans, i.e. flood tolerant and flood sensitive, were planted in plant pots in a controlled greenhouse. A low-cost 3D imaging system was developed to take measurements of plant architecture including plant height, plant canopy width, petiole length, and petiole angle. It was found that the measurement error of the 3D imaging system was 5.8\% in length and 5.0\% in angle, which was sufficiently accurate and useful in plant phenotyping. Collected data were used to monitor the development of soybean after flood treatment. Dry biomass of soybean plant was measured at the end of the vegetative stage (two months after emergence). Results show that four groups had a significant difference in plant height, plant canopy width, petiole length, and petiole angle. Flood stress at early stages of soybean accelerated the growth of the flood-resistant plants in height and the petiole angle, however, restrained the development in plant canopy width and the petiole length of flood-sensitive plants. The dry biomass of flood-sensitive plants was near two to three times lower than that of resistant plants at the end of the vegetative stage. The results indicate that the developed low-cost 3D imaging system has the potential for accurate measurements in plant architecture and dry biomass that may be used to improve the accuracy of plant phenotyping.},

	abstract = {Abstract Studying the detailed organization of plant canopy structure allows a better understanding of functional processes in functional-structural plant models (FSPM). Canopy gap fraction (CGF) is an important indicator describing the canopy structure and affects the way plants capture light to perform photosynthesis, especially the interception of diffuse light. Though efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CGF measurement and estimation, current technologies are usually position limited. Thus, this work developed new virtual methods for computing CGF and diffuse light interception in the 3D space of plant canopies. Five hierarchical hemispheres, containing 15, 40, 360, 1,440, and 5760 triangle patches, respectively, were constructed by applying Sqrt-3 and Butterfly subdivision schemes on an original icosahedron. Compared with traditional hemisphere division strategies using solid angles or crossed arcs of latitude and longitude, the proposed hierarchical hemispheres provide more resolution choices for different accuracy demands. Most of the patches on the hemispheres are regular triangles with similar sizes, which improves the CGF and diffuse light calculation accuracy using the Turtle model. Acceleration mechanism was built when calculating the detection of plant facets in the canopy using the tree relationship between adjacent hemispheres. Two geometric models and six maize canopy geometric models with cultivar and density differences were constructed using measured data to validate the approach. The maximum CGF error was 1.39\% for the two geometric models. The average error of the four derived CGFs from hemisphere photographs was 4.23\%. The diffuse light distribution correlation coefficients R 2 were 0.96, 0.98, and 0.90 for three different canopy densities. Our algorithm provides multi-scale hemisphere choices for CGF and diffuse light interception simulation. The study also paves the way for further investigation into plant canopy structure analysis and simulation of light dynamics in plant canopies.},

	abstract = {The fitness of the rape leaf is closely related to its biomass and photosynthesis. The study of leaf traits is significant for improving rape leaf production and optimizing crop management. Canopy structure and individual leaf traits are the major indicators of quality during the rape seedling stage. Differences in canopy structure reflect the influence of environmental factors such as water, sunlight and nutrient supply. The traits of individual rape leaves traits indicate the growth period of the rape as well as its canopy shape. We established a high-throughput stereo-imaging system for the reconstruction of the three-dimensional canopy structure of rape seedlings from which leaf area and plant height can be extracted. To evaluate the measurement accuracy of leaf area and plant height, 66 rape seedlings were randomly selected for automatic and destructive measurements. Compared with the manual measurements, the mean absolute percentage error of automatic leaf area and plant height measurements was 3.68 and 6.18\%, respectively, and the squares of the correlation coefficients (R2) were 0.984 and 0.845, respectively. Compared with the two-dimensional projective imaging method, the leaf area extracted using stereo-imaging was more accurate. In addition, a semi-automatic image analysis pipeline was developed to extract 19 individual leaf shape traits, including 11 scale-invariant traits, 3 inner cavity related traits, and 5 margin-related traits, from the images acquired by the stereo-imaging system. We used these quantified traits to classify rapes according to three different leaf shapes: mosaic-leaf, semi-mosaic-leaf, and round-leaf. Based on testing of 801 seedling rape samples, we found that the leave-one-out cross validation classification accuracy was 94.4, 95.6, and 94.8\% for stepwise discriminant analysis, the support vector machine method and the random forest method, respectively. In this study, a nondestructive and high-throughput stereo-imaging system was developed to quantify canopy three-dimensional structure and individual leaf shape traits with improved accuracy, with implications for rape phenotyping, functional genomics, and breeding.},

Sensors for measuring crop parameters with an acceptable accuracy and high reliability at a reasonable price are essential prerequisite to obtain this information. In the last years laser rangefinder sensors are adopted in many industrial applications. In agricultural engineering the potential of laser rangefinders for measuring crop parameters is nearby unexploited. This paper reports the design and the performance of a triangulation laser based system for measuring crop biomass density under field conditions in the vegetation period 2005. The main parameter for potential assessment was the coefficient of determination R{\textasciicircum}2 of the relation between crop biomass density (related on fresh and dry matter) and the mean height of the laser reflection point in crop stands from oilseed rape, winter rye, winter wheat, and grassland. In oilseed rape, winter rye and winter wheat R{\textasciicircum}2 was calculated in the range from 0.93 to 0.99. Caused by variable morphologic features on grassland R{\textasciicircum}2 was reduced in the range from 0.88 to 0.94. Taking into account that large crop stand areas can be sensed by a laser rangefinder in a short time, a high potential for site specific crop management can be concluded.},

	abstract = {Leaf water content (LWC) within a plant canopy plays an important role in light penetration and scattering, thus affecting reflectance simulation with radiative transfer models. It is also of key importance for the distribution of other plant biochemical parameters, fire propagation simulation and habitat suitability evaluation. Although passive remote sensing techniques have been widely applied to estimate LWC, they are unable to retrieve the LWC vertical distribution within a canopy. In this paper we investigated the applicability of the full-waveform terrestrial laser scanning data (TLS) to estimate the LWC vertical distribution within the canopy of individual plants. A modified skewed Gaussian function that accommodates the nonlinear nature of the system was proposed to perform a decomposition on the full-waveform data. The amplitude, the backscatter cross-section, and the backscatter coefficient were assessed to estimate LWC, respectively. Our results showed that the backscatter coefficient had the strongest correlation with LWC (R 2  = 0.66) for four plant species after an incidence angle correction. Good agreements were achieved between the predicted vertical profile of LWC and the measured vertical profile of LWC with a mean RMSE (root mean square error) value of 0.001 g/cm 2 and a mean MAPE (mean absolute percent error) value of 4.46\%. However, the performance of LWC vertical profile estimation varied across species, suggesting the influence of leaf structure other than LWC on waveform features, which should be considered in future studies. Nevertheless, our study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of retrieving LWC vertical distribution within plant canopy from a full-waveform terrestrial laser scanner.},

	abstract = {With the rapid rising of global population, the demand for improving breeding techniques to greatly increase the worldwide crop production has become more and more urgent. Most researchers believe that the key to new breeding techniques lies in genetic improvement of crops, which leads to a large quantity of phenotyping spots. Unfortunately, current phenotyping solutions are not powerful enough to handle so many spots with satisfying speed and accuracy. As a result, high-throughput phenotyping is drawing more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a new field-based sensing solution to high-throughput phenotyping. We mount a LiDAR (Velodyne HDL64-S3) on a mobile robot, making the robot a “phenomobile.” We develop software for data collection and analysis under Robotic Operating System using open source components and algorithm libraries. Different from conducting phenotyping observations with an in-row and one-by-one manner, our new solution allows the robot to move around the parcel to collect data. Thus, the 3D and 360° view laser scanner can collect phenotyping data for a large plant group at the same time, instead of one by one. Furthermore, no touching interference from the robot would be imposed onto the crops. We conduct experiments for maize plant on two parcels. We implement point cloud merging with landmarks and Iterative Closest Points to cut down the time consumption. We then recognize and compute the morphological phenotyping parameters (row spacing and plant height) of maize plant using depth-band histograms and horizontal point density. We analyze the cloud registration and merging performances, the row spacing detection accuracy, and the single plant height computation accuracy. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {Dense surface registration, commonly used in computer science, could aid the biological sciences in accurate and comprehensive quantification of biological phenotypes. However, few toolboxes exist that are openly available, non-expert friendly, and validated in a way relevant to biologists. Here, we report a customizable toolbox for reproducible high-throughput dense phenotyping of 3D images, specifically geared towards biological use. Given a target image, a template is first oriented, repositioned, and scaled to the target during a scaled rigid registration step, then transformed further to fit the specific shape of the target using a non-rigid transformation. As validation, we use n = 41 3D facial images to demonstrate that the MeshMonk registration is accurate, with 1.26 mm average error, across 19 landmarks, between placements from manual observers and using the MeshMonk toolbox. We also report no variation in landmark position or centroid size significantly attributable to landmarking method used. Though validated using 19 landmarks, the MeshMonk toolbox produces a dense mesh of vertices across the entire surface, thus facilitating more comprehensive investigations of 3D shape variation. This expansion opens up exciting avenues of study in assessing biological shapes to better understand their phenotypic variation, genetic and developmental underpinnings, and evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Recently, imaged-based approaches have developed rapidly for high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP). Imaging reduces a 3D plant into 2D images, which makes the retrieval of plant morphological traits challenging. We developed a novel LiDAR-based phenotyping instrument to generate 3D point clouds of single plants. The instrument combined a LiDAR scanner with a precision rotation stage on which an individual plant was placed. A LabVIEW program was developed to control the scanning and rotation motion, synchronize the measurements from both devices, and capture a 360\&deg; view point cloud. A data processing pipeline was developed for noise removal, voxelization, triangulation, and plant leaf surface reconstruction. Once the leaf digital surfaces were reconstructed, plant morphological traits, including individual and total leaf area, leaf inclination angle, and leaf angular distribution, were derived. The system was tested with maize and sorghum plants. The results showed that leaf area measurements by the instrument were highly correlated with the reference methods (R2 \&gt; 0.91 for individual leaf area; R2 \&gt; 0.95 for total leaf area of each plant). Leaf angular distributions of the two species were also derived. This instrument could fill a critical technological gap for indoor HTPP of plant morphological traits in 3D.},

	abstract = {Root systems play an essential role in ensuring plant productivity. Experiments conducted in controlled environments and simulation models suggest that root geometry and responses of root architecture to environmental factors should be studied as a priority. However, compared with aboveground plant organs, roots are not easily accessible by non-invasive analyses and field research is still based almost completely on manual, destructive methods. Contributing to reducing the gap between laboratory and field experiments, we present a novel phenotyping system (GROWSCREEN-Rhizo), which is capable of automatically imaging roots and shoots of plants grown in soil-filled rhizotrons (up to a volume of {\textasciitilde}18 L) with a throughput of 60 rhizotrons per hour. Analysis of plants grown in this setup is restricted to a certain plant size (up to a shoot height of 80 cm and root-system depth of 90 cm). We performed validation experiments using six different species and for barley and maize, we studied the effect of moderate soil compaction, which is a relevant factor in the field. First, we found that the portion of root systems that is visible through the rhizotrons’ transparent plate is representative of the total root system. The percentage of visible roots decreases with increasing average root diameter of the plant species studied and depends, to some extent, on environmental conditions. Second, we could measure relatively minor changes in root-system architecture induced by a moderate increase in soil compaction. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the good potential of this methodology to characterise root geometry and temporal growth responses with relatively high spatial accuracy and resolution for both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Our prototype will allow the design of high-throughput screening methodologies simulating environmental scenarios that are relevant in the field and will support breeding efforts towards improved resource use efficiency and stability of crop yields.},

	volume = {15},
	doi = {10.1186/s13007-019-0394-z},
	abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB) is a basic agronomic parameter for field investigation and is frequently used to indicate crop growth status, the effects of agricultural management practices, and the ability to sequester carbon above and below ground. The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas. In this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors. These results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic modeling of crop interactions with the atmosphere requires knowledge of the canopy architecture. For example, studies of light and rainfall interception and microwave radiative transfer modeling have motivated the development of a number of virtual canopies by agronomists, computer scientists, and hydrologists. While a number of canopy measuring techniques are already available, recent improvements in digital photography and the availability of affordable commercial photogrammetry packages have created an opportunity to develop highly detailed three-dimensional digital models of maize canopies. Here, we present a non-destructive one-man methodology to digitize plants that uses an unmodified consumer grade digital single-lens reflex (SLR) camera and commercially available photogrammetry software. This methodology allows tracking of individual plant development, which was not possible in earlier techniques. The construction of the digital plant model is divided into three parts: plant preparation, where several artificial targets are placed on the plant and their relative distances are measured; leaf digitizing in which the targets are marked and referenced by the software, thereby allowing the photographs to be oriented; and the creation of three-dimensional models of individual leaves and the final model buildup when, through cross-referencing, the complete digital plant model is arranged. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented methodology by digitizing the same plant at two different stages of development (6 and 10 leaves) and subsequently assessing the models’ precision. In both cases, the objective is to define the edges and mid-rib of the leaves as well as their vertical and horizontal orientation; this allows the calculation of geometric descriptive parameters including plant area, leaf overlap, leaf area index, and gap fraction. The two presented models were built from 48 and 119 pictures, respectively, which correspond to 348 and 1553 three-dimensional points.},

Since 2D based approaches have their inherent limitations, 3D plant analysis is becoming state of the art for current phenotyping technologies. We present an automated system for analyzing plant growth in indoor conditions. A gantry robot system is used to perform scanning tasks in an automated manner throughout the lifetime of the plant. A 3D laser scanner mounted as the robot's payload captures the surface point cloud data of the plant from multiple views. The plant is monitored from the vegetative to reproductive stages in light/dark cycles inside a controllable growth chamber. An efficient 3D reconstruction algorithm is used, by which multiple scans are aligned together to obtain a 3D mesh of the plant, followed by surface area and volume computations. The whole system, including the programmable growth chamber, robot, scanner, data transfer and analysis is fully automated in such a way that a naive user can, in theory, start the system with a mouse click and get back the growth analysis results at the end of the lifetime of the plant with no intermediate intervention. As evidence of its functionality, we show and analyze quantitative results of the rhythmic growth patterns of the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana(L.), and the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants under their diurnal light/dark cycles.},

This would not only broaden the application range of phenotyping in the plant research community, but also increase the ability for researchers to study plants in their natural environments. By studying plants in their natural environment in high temporal resolution, more knowledge on how multiple stresses interact in defining the plant phenotype could lead to a better understanding of the interaction between plant responses and epigenetic regulation. In the present paper, we evaluate a commercial 3D NIR-laser scanner (PlantEye, Phenospex B.V., Herleen, The Netherlands) to track daily changes in plant growth with high precision in challenging environments. Firstly, we demonstrate that the NIR laser beam of the scanner does not affect plant photosynthetic performance. Secondly, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate phenotypic variation amongst the growth pattern of ten genotypes of Brassica napus L. (rapeseed), using a simple linear correlation between scanned parameters and destructive growth measurements. Our results demonstrate the high potential of 3D laser triangulation for simple measurements of phenotypic variation in challenging environments and in a high temporal resolution.},

Canopy architecture is inherently 3D, but many approaches to measuring canopy architecture component traits treat the canopy as a two dimensional structure in order to make large scale measurement, selective breeding, and gene identification logistically feasible. We develop a high throughput voxel carving strategy to reconstruct three dimensional representations of maize and sorghum from a small number of RGB photos. This approach was employed to generate three dimensional reconstructions of a sorghum association population at the late vegetative stage of development. Light interception parameters estimated from these reconstructions enabled the identification of both known and previously unreported loci controlling light interception efficiency in sorghum. The approach described here is generalizable and scalable and it enables 3D reconstructions from existing plant high throughput phenotyping datasets. For future datasets we propose a set of best practices to increase the accuracy of three dimensional reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Plant canopy structure can strongly affect crop functions such as yield and stress tolerance, and canopy size is an important aspect of canopy structure. Manual assessment of canopy size is laborious and imprecise, and cannot measure multi-dimensional traits such as projected leaf area and canopy volume. Field-based high throughput phenotyping systems with imaging capabilities can rapidly acquire data about plants in field conditions, making it possible to quantify and monitor plant canopy development. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D imaging approach to quantitatively analyze cotton canopy development in field conditions. A cotton field was planted with 128 plots, including four genotypes of 32 plots each. The field was scanned by GPhenoVision (a customized field-based high throughput phenotyping system) to acquire color and depth images with GPS information in 2016 covering two growth stages: canopy development, and flowering and boll development. A data processing pipeline was developed, consisting of three steps: plot point cloud reconstruction, plant canopy segmentation, and trait extraction. Plot point clouds were reconstructed using color and depth images with GPS information. In colorized point clouds, vegetation was segmented from the background using an excess-green (ExG) color filter, and cotton canopies were further separated from weeds based on height, size, and position information. Static morphological traits were extracted on each day, including univariate traits (maximum and mean canopy height and width, projected canopy area, and concave and convex volumes) and a multivariate trait (cumulative height profile). Growth rates were calculated for univariate static traits, quantifying canopy growth and development. Linear regressions were performed between the traits and fiber yield to identify the best traits and measurement time for yield prediction. The results showed that fiber yield was correlated with static traits after the canopy development stage (R2= 0.35-0.71) and growth rates in early canopy development stages (R2= 0.29-0.52). Multi-dimensional traits (e.g., projected canopy area and volume) outperformed one-dimensional traits, and the multivariate trait (cumulative height profile) outperformed univariate traits. The proposed approach would be useful for identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling canopy size in genetics/genomics studies or for fiber yield prediction in breeding programs and production environments.},

Color characteristics and plant height as well as canopy breadth are important aspects of the canopy phenotype of soybean plants. High-throughput phenotyping systems with imaging capabilities providing color and depth information can rapidly acquire data of soybean plants, making it possible to quantify and monitor soybean canopy development. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D imaging approach to quantitatively analyze soybean canopy development under natural light conditions. Thus, a Kinect sensor-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform was developed for soybean plant phenotyping. To calculate color traits accurately, the distortion phenomenon of color images was first registered in accordance with the principle of three primary colors and color constancy. Then, the registered color images were applied to depth images for the reconstruction of the colorized three-dimensional canopy structure. Furthermore, the 3D point cloud of soybean canopies was extracted from the background according to adjusted threshold, and each area of individual potted soybean plants in the depth images was segmented for the calculation of phenotypic traits. Finally, color indices, plant height and canopy breadth were assessed based on 3D point cloud of soybean canopies. The results showed that the maximum error of registration for the R, G, and B bands in the dataset was 1.26\%, 1.09\%, and 0.75\%, respectively. Correlation analysis between the sensors and manual measurements yielded R2 values of 0.99, 0.89, and 0.89 for plant height, canopy breadth in the west-east (W–E) direction, and canopy breadth in the north-south (N–S) direction, and R2 values of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.80 for color indices h, s, and i, respectively. Given these results, the proposed approaches provide new opportunities for the identification of the quantitative traits that control canopy structure in genetic/genomic studies or for soybean yield prediction in breeding programs.},

	abstract = {Phenotyping under field environmental conditions is often considered as a bottleneck in crop breeding. Unmanned aerial vehicle high throughput phenotypic platform (UAV-HTPP) mounted with multi-sensors offers an efficiency, non-invasive, flexible and low-cost solution in large-scale breeding programs compared to ground investigation, especially where measurements are time-sensitive. This study was conducted at the research station of the Xiao Tangshan National Precision Agriculture Research Center of China. Using the UAV-HTPP, RGB and multispectral images were acquired during four critical growth stages of maize. We present a method of extracting plant height (PH) at the plot scale using UAV-HTPP based on the spatial structure of the maize canopy. The core steps of this method are segmentation and spatial Kriging interpolation based on multiple neighboring maximum pixels from multiple plants in a plot. Then, the relationships between the PH extracted from imagery collected using UAV-HTPP and the ground truth were examined. We developed a semi-automated pipeline for extracting, analyzing and evaluating multiple phenotypic traits: canopy cover (CC), normalized vegetation index (NDVI), PH, average growth rate of plant height (AGRPH), and contribution rate of plant height (CRPH). For these traits, we identify genotypic differences and analyze and evaluate dynamics and development trends during different maize growth stages. Furthermore, we introduce a time series data clustering analysis method into breeding programs as a tool to obtain a novel representative trait: typical curve. We classified and named nine types of typical curves of these traits based on curve morphological features. We found that typical curves can detect differences in the genetic background of traits. For the best results, the recognition rate of an NDVI typical curve is 59\%, far less than the 82.3\% of the CRPH typical curve. Our study provides evidence that the PH trait is among the most heritable and the NDVI trait is among the most easily affected by the external environment in maize.},

The traditional measurement scheme is time-consuming and not suitable for continuously monitoring plant growth and health. Individual vegetable seedling quick segmentation is the prerequisite for high-throughput seedling phenotype data extraction at individual seedling level. This paper proposes an efficient learning- and model-free 3D point cloud data processing pipeline to measure the plant height and leaf area of every single seedling in a plug tray. The 3D point clouds are obtained by a low-cost red–green–blue (RGB)-Depth (RGB-D) camera. Firstly, noise reduction is performed on the original point clouds through the processing of useable-area filter, depth cut-off filter, and neighbor count filter. Secondly, the surface feature histograms-based approach is used to automatically remove the complicated natural background. Then, the Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation (VCCS) and Locally Convex Connected Patches (LCCP) algorithms are employed for individual vegetable seedling partition. Finally, the height and projected leaf area of respective seedlings are calculated based on segmented point clouds and validation is carried out. Critically, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method for different growth conditions and species. The experimental results show that the proposed method could be used to quickly calculate the morphological parameters of each seedling and it is practical to use this approach for high-throughput seedling phenotyping.},

          Background Nowadays, automated phenotyping of plants is essential for precise and cost-effective improvement in the efficiency of crop genetics. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have shown great success in the classification and modelling of crop parameters. In this research, we consider the capability of ML to perform grain yield prediction in soybeans by combining data from different optical sensors via RF (Random Forest) and XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). During the 2018 growing season, a panel of 382 soybean recombinant inbred lines were evaluated in a yield trial at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) in West Lafayette (Indiana, USA). Images were acquired by the Parrot Sequoia Multispectral Sensor and the S.O.D.A. compact digital camera on board a senseFly eBee UAS (Unnamed Aircraft System) solution at R4 and early R5 growth stages. Next, a standard photogrammetric pipeline was carried out by SfM (Structure from Motion). Multispectral imagery serves to analyse the spectral response of the soybean end-member in 2D. In addition, RGB images were used to reconstruct the study area in 3D, evaluating the physiological growth dynamics per plot via height variations and crop volume estimations. As ground truth, destructive grain yield measurements were taken at the end of the growing season. Results Algorithms and feature extraction techniques were combined to develop a regression model to predict final yield from imagery, achieving an accuracy of over 90.72\% by RF and 91.36\% by XGBoost. Conclusions Results provide practical information for the selection of phenotypes for breeding coming from UAS data as a decision support tool, affording constant operational improvement and proactive management for high spatial precision.},

	abstract = {Many plants can modify their leaf profile rapidly in response to environmental stress. Image-based data are increasingly used to retrieve reliable information on plant water status in a non-contact manner that has the potential to be scaled to high-throughput and repeated through time. This paper examined the variation of leaf angle as measured by both 3D images and goniometer in progressively drought stressed grapevine. Grapevines, grown in pots, were subjected to a 21-day period of drought stress receiving 100\% (CTRL), 60\% (IRR60\%) and 30\% (IRR30\%) of maximum soil available water capacity. Leaf angle was (i) measured manually (goniometer) and (ii) computed by a 3D reconstruction method (multi-view stereo and structure from motion). Stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, fluorescence (Fv/Fm), leaf area and 2D RGB data were simultaneously collected during drought imposition. Throughout the experiment, values of leaf water potential ranged from −0.4 (CTRL) to −1.1 MPa (IRR30\%) and it linearly influenced the leaf angle when measured manually (R2 = 0.86) and with 3D image (R2 = 0.73). Drought was negatively related to stomatal conductance and leaf area growth particularly in IRR30\% while photosynthetic parameters (i.e., Fv/Fm) were not impaired by water restriction. A model for leaf area estimation based on the number of pixels of 2D RGB images developed at a different phenotyping robotized platform in a closely related experiment was successfully employed (R2 = 0.78). At the end of the experiment, top view 2D RGB images showed a ∼50\% reduction of greener fraction (GGF) in CTRL and IRR60\% vines compared to initial values, while GGF in IRR30\% increased by approximately 20\%.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a novel approach for terrestrial vegetation monitoring. The in situ continuous optical remote sensing tool in conjunction with concurrent eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements provides a new opportunity to advance terrestrial ecosystem science. Here we introduce a network of ground-based SIF observations at flux tower sites across the mainland China referred as ChinaSpec. Until now, it consists of 15 tower sites including 5 cropland sites, 4 grassland sites, 4 forest sites and 2 wetland sites. At each of these sites, an automated spectroscopy system was deployed to collect continuous super-high resolution spectra for high-frequency SIF retrievals in synergy with EC flux measurements. The goal of ChinaSpec is to provide ground SIF measurements and promote the collaborations between optical remote sensing and EC flux communities in China. We present here the details of instrument specifications, data collection and processing procedures, data sharing and utilization protocols, and future plans. Furthermore, we show the examples how ground SIF observations can be used to track vegetation photosynthesis from diurnal to seasonal scales, to assist in the validation of fluorescence models and satellite SIF products (e.g., from OCO-2, TanSat and TROPOMI) with the measurements from these sites since 2016. This network of SIF observations could improve our understanding of the controls on the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange and enable the improvement of carbon flux predictions. This SIF network will also help integrate ground SIF measurements with EC flux networks which will advance ecosystem and carbon cycle researches globally.},

In addition, the extracted 3D grain traits were used to classify the rice varieties, and the support vector machine classifier had a higher recognition accuracy than the stepwise discriminant analysis and random forest classifiers. In conclusion, we developed a 3D image analysis pipeline to extract rice grain traits using X-ray computed tomography that can provide more 3D grain information and could benefit future research on rice functional genomics and rice breeding.},

	abstract = {The traditional paradigm of applying deep learning -- collect, annotate and train on data -- is not applicable to image-based plant phenotyping as almost 400,000 different plant species exists. Data costs include growing physical samples, imaging and labelling them. Model performance is impacted by the species gap between the domain of each plant species, it is not generalisable and may not transfer to unseen plant species. In this paper, we investigate the use of synthetic data for leaf instance segmentation. We study multiple synthetic data training regimes using Mask-RCNN when few or no annotated real data is available. We also present UPGen: a Universal Plant Generator for bridging the species gap. UPGen leverages domain randomisation to produce widely distributed data samples and models stochastic biological variation. Our methods outperform standard practices, such as transfer learning from publicly available plant data, by 26.6\% and 51.46\% on two unseen plant species respectively. We benchmark UPGen by competing in the CVPPP Leaf Segmentation Challenge and set a new state-of-the-art, a mean of 88\% across A1-4 test datasets.

	abstract = {The local environment of the geographical origin of plants shaped their genetic variations through environmental adaptation. While the characteristics of the local environment correlate with the genotypes and other genomic features of the plants, they can also be indicative of genotype-phenotype associations providing additional information relevant to environmental dependence. In this study, we investigate how the geoclimatic features from the geographical origin of the
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              accessions can be integrated with genomic features for phenotype prediction and association analysis using advanced canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In particular, we propose a novel method called hierarchical canonical correlation analysis (HCCA) to combine mutations, gene expressions, and DNA methylations with geoclimatic features for informative coprojections of the features. HCCA uses a condition number of the cross-covariance between pairs of datasets to infer a hierarchical structure for applying CCA to combine the data. In the experiments on
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              data from 1001 Genomes and 1001 Epigenomes projects and climatic, atmospheric, and soil environmental variables combined by CLIMtools, HCCA provided a joint representation of the genomic data and geoclimate data for better prediction of the special flowering time at 10°C (FT10) of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . We also extended HCCA with information from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to guide the feature learning by imposing network modules onto the genomic features, which are shown to be useful for identifying genes with more coherent functions correlated with the geoclimatic features. The findings in this study suggest that environmental data comprise an important component in plant phenotype analysis. HCCA is a useful data integration technique for phenotype prediction, and a better understanding of the interactions between gene functions and environment as more useful functional information is introduced by coprojections of multiple genomic datasets.},

	abstract = {增加种植密度是提高玉米产量的重要措施之一,但是种植密度增加后玉米茎秆机械强度降低,倒伏现象严重。倒伏不仅降低了玉米产量和品质,同时也增加了机械收获难度。玉米高密度种植时具有较大的叶面积指数,导致营养生长至灌浆早期冠层中下部叶片的相互遮荫和光合有效辐射大幅下降。叶片在遮荫或者弱光条件下的光合能力下降,使转运到茎秆中的碳水化合物降低。由此推测,密植条件下玉米冠层内部光照强度下降可能是引起基部节间强度降低、倒伏增加的重要因素。基于上述推论,本文设置不同种植密度、整体遮荫和局部剪叶等试验处理改变玉米冠层的光照环境,通过对不同光环境下玉米植株形态、基部节间外部形态及内部碳水化合物组分、解剖结构、机械强度和倒伏率等进行系统研究,探讨冠层光环境对玉米节间发育的影响机制;明确玉米节间碳水化合物变化与解剖结构及机械强度的相互关系;揭示玉米冠层光分布与茎秆机械强度形成及抗倒伏能力的关系。研究结果可为玉米密植高产稳产栽培及耐密抗倒品种选育提供理论依据。主要研究内容和结果如下:1 种植密度对玉米节间发育的影响玉米节间发育过程中先进行快速增粗和伸长,接着节间干物质快速积累、茎壁的结构性化学组分合成,最后是茎秆强度形成。其中基部节间穿刺强度(RPS)快速形成期大约在拔节后14 d至25 d。随着种植密度增加,玉米基部节间形态快速建成的起始时间和终止时间均有所提前。在高密度条件下,玉米基部节间快速伸长速率提高,使节间变长;而节间快速增粗、干物质积累持续期缩短,导致节间变细,节间单位长度干重(DWUL)降低,茎秆抗倒伏强度有所下降。2 密植条件下玉米冠层内部光照强度对茎秆抗倒伏能力的影响增加种植密度降低玉米冠层内部的光照强度,玉米基部节间单位长度干重和穿刺强度有所降低,倒伏率增加。与自然光照下相比较,对玉米冠层进行30\%和60\%遮荫后,基部节间单位长度干重分别降低40\%和50\%;穿刺强度分别降低40\%和50\%;倒伏率增加10\%和20\%。由此可知,玉米冠层光照强度是影响节间强度形成和倒伏发生的重要因素。3 遮荫和剪叶处理对玉米茎秆强度和倒伏的影响整体遮荫处理后,明显增加了玉米株高和穗位高,但植株重心高度有所降低。遮荫后玉米基部节间长度增加、直径变小;穿刺强度降低,倒伏率增加。进一步分析节间碳水化合物可知:遮荫处理后显著降低基部节间单位长度干重、水溶性碳水化合物(WSC)、纤维素、木质素和半纤维素的含量,且对WSC含量的影响程度最大。由此说明,遮荫后由于玉米节间WSC含量降低,使节间结构性碳水化合物含量显著降低,倒伏率增加。在玉米抽雄期局部剪去棒三叶以上全部或1/2叶片(RAE或RAE/2)后,基部第3节间单位长度结构性碳水化合物含量显著增加,穿刺强度分别提高5.4-11.6\%和7.7-8.2\%,倒伏率分别下降4.9-7.8\%和4.2-4.6\%。抽雄前剪去玉米棒三叶以下3片叶(RBE),基部第3节间单位长度结构性碳水化合物含量显著降低,穿刺强度降低9.1-17.4\%,倒伏率增加7.0-11.2\%。抽雄前剪去玉米冠层底部3片叶(RB),第3节结构性碳水化合物含量、穿刺强度和倒伏率无显著变化。由此表明,玉米棒三叶以下3片叶是基部节间碳水化合物积累和机械强度形成的关键叶层。4 玉米节间碳水化合物、解剖结构与茎秆机械强度的关系茎秆RPS形成主要在节间定长后,节间DWUL中后期积累为RPS形成提供物质来源。高密度条件下玉米基部节间纤维素和木质素积累的起始和终止时间均提前;节间纤维素和木质素快速积累速率下降,使节间外皮组织发育受阻;节间RPS形成速率下降,最终导致RPS显著降低。因此,生产中应在拔节期通过农艺和化学调控等措施,控制玉米节间伸长速率,缩短节长,增加单位长度干重;使茎秆纤维素和木质素积累速率加快,茎秆强度提高,从而降低田间倒伏率。5 改善玉米冠层光分布对茎秆抗倒伏能力的影响玉米穗位至穗下1/2叶层功能对基部节间干物质积累和机械强度形成有至关重要的作用,提高玉米穗位层光照强度以及穗位至穗下1/2层光截获量可显著提高基部节间单位长度干重、结构性碳水化合物含量和穿刺强度,显著减少田间倒伏率。因此,高密条件下选用植株上部叶片较小、直立的玉米高产品种,有利于冠层下部透光,提高基部节间的机械强度和抗倒伏能力,为实现玉米大面积密植高产栽培技术提供必要的保障。},

	abstract = {高密度栽培已经成为目前玉米高产潜力挖掘的关键措施之一,但是群体密度的增加增加了玉米倒伏的风险。吉林省年平均降水量654.3毫米,且降雨多集中在7-8月,正值玉米生长抽雄-灌浆的关键时期,在高温、多雨多风的气候影响下,倒伏已成为影响耐密性玉米实现高产的重要原因之一。关于玉米倒伏的研究已有一些研究,但关于群体密度对玉米地上部茎秆和地下部根系倒伏特性的系统研究并不多见。本研究主要探讨不同密度对玉米茎秆及根系形态、干物质及相关生理特性的变化,探明其和倒伏率的相关关.系,以揭示玉米的倒伏机理,为吉林省玉米抗倒伏栽培及育种提供量化参考依据。 	本研究选择7个种植密度,2009-2011年选择4个抗倒伏性能不同的品种,采用随机区组设计,通过茎秆和根系形态、干物质及相关生理指标的测定,分析其和茎秆强度及倒伏率的相关性。2012年,以吉林省11个主导品种为试验材料,从形态学和生理学角度,研究“布拉万”台风对不同玉米品种的影响,探明不同玉米品种的倒伏特征。研究结果表明： 	1、茎秆农艺性状的结果为：穗位高和穗位高系数随着密度的增加逐渐增加,株高在7万株／公顷的密度下达到最大；郑单958的穗位高和穗位高系数对密度的变化不敏感。先玉420和先玉335倒伏率与穗位高和穗位高系数呈现极显著正相关,益丰29和郑单958则与株高、穗位高和穗位高系数均无显著相关性。同一品种相同节间粗随密度增加逐渐降低、节间长度无规律性变化。节间干物质百分比、单位茎长干重、节间强度均随密度增加先升高后降低,在7和8万株／公顷出现最大值,各品种表现不同。两个玉米品种其倒伏率与第3、4节茎长、茎粗、单位茎长干重、茎秆强度均显著相关。品种间比较,益丰29和郑单958第2-6节间干物质百分比、单位茎长干重、节间强度、穗位高及穗位高系数均高于先玉335和先玉420,株高则相反。 	2、茎秆木质素及关键合成酶活性结果为：不同密度处理下,平均节间纤维素含量、木质素含量、PAL活性、TAL活性和CAD活性均为益丰29高于先玉420。益丰29节间PAL、TAL活性节间表现为第3节间{\textgreater}第4节间{\textgreater}第5节间。CAD活性各节间变化因品种而不同,先玉420第4节{\textgreater}第3节{\textgreater}第5节,益丰29第3节{\textgreater}第4节{\textgreater}第5节。先玉420节间木质素含量与CAD活性显著正相关,益丰29则与PAL活性和TAL活性呈显著正相关。在抽雄期和灌浆初期,益丰29节间强度与木质素含量、PAL活性、TAL活性显著正相关,先玉420与TAL呈显著正相关。 	3、茎秆化学成分及矿质元素结果为：随着密度的增加,节间N、K、Si、Ca、Mg、Zn含量均先升高后降低,最高点均出现在7万株／公顷和8万株／公顷,因品种和生育时期而不同。品种间益丰29高于先玉420。玉米茎秆强度与K、Si和淀粉含量呈现显著正相关,与N、Ca、Mg含量呈现正相关,但不显著,与Zn和可溶性糖含量相关性不大。益丰29和先玉420第3、4、5节间茎秆强度和Si含量均呈现显著正相关,与其他指标相关性因节间和生育时期而不同。 	4、根系特征及生理特性结果为：气生根和总根数量随着密度的增加先微升高后降低,在7万株/公顷数量最多。先玉420根系干重随着密度的变化先增加后降低,益丰29、先玉335和先玉420均呈降低-升高-降低的变化,低谷和高峰分别出现在6万株/公顷和7万株/公顷。从密度8万株/公顷,各品种根系活力开始下降,郑单958降幅最大。在玉米抽雄期,根系SOD、POD和CAT活性在7万株/公顷达最大值后,密度继续增加,酶活性降低；在灌浆初期,先玉335的SOD和POD活性随密度变化呈现“M,,型曲线,其他品种均为单峰曲线。各项指标均为郑单958和先玉335高于益丰29和先玉420,丙二醛相反。玉米倒伏率与气生根和总根数量、干物质百分比和根系活力呈现极显著负相关,与其他指标相关性不大。 	5、“布拉万”台风对玉米倒伏及产量的影响结果为：供试11个玉米品种以良玉99倒伏能力最强,其穗位高系数、第1-6节间平均直径、节间干重、单位茎长干重、茎秆可溶性糖含量、木质素含量、Si含量及茎秆强度均处于较高水平；其气生根数目、根系干重及干物质比较高。银河32和银河33抗倒伏能力最差,各项指标均处于最低水平。尽管良玉99抗倒伏能力较强,但其产量显著低于郑单958和先玉335。2012年,郑单958产量仅比2009-2011年三年平均产量降低5.13\%,表现出较强的产量稳定性。 	综上所述,群体密度对玉米茎秆和根系形态、干物质及相关生理特性均产生一定的影响。在有限的资源下,密度过高或过低均不利于生长,产生一定的密度效应。玉米倒伏是品种特性、栽培技术及土壤、气候等内外因素综合作用的结果。因此,在选择玉米抗倒伏品种时,应综合考虑形态和生理指标,合理密植,合理施肥,适量追施微量元素肥料,以降低倒伏的风险,保证玉米生产潜力得到充分发挥。此外,抗倒伏能力和产量并非呈现极显著的正相关,如何选育出抗倒伏能力强且产量高的玉米品种,或是如何通过栽培技术措施使得抗倒伏玉米品种能够最大程度的发挥出高产潜力,实现良种良法的配套是未来育种及栽培工作者共同面临的挑战和研究方向。本研究仅为玉米抗倒伏形态及生理机制提供科学的理论依据。},

	abstract = {本研究选用抗倒性不同的6个小麦品种,通过设置不同种植密度、氮肥施用量和喷施多效唑等栽培措施,于2008年～2010年系统研究了小麦茎秆形态特征、解剖结构特征和茎秆理化特性及其抗倒伏能力的变化,分析了不同抗倒伏能力小麦茎秆特征的品种差异,探讨了种植密度、氮肥和多效唑对小麦抗倒伏能力的影响及其生理生化机理。主要研究结果如下: 	1小麦抗倒伏性的品种差异 	1.1不同抗倒伏能力小麦品种茎秆形态特征 	与抗倒伏能力较差的小麦品种(藁城8901和烟农21)相比,抗倒伏能力强的小麦品种(济麦20和济麦22)的株高、重心高度、基部节间长度和基部(1+2)节间占总茎长的比例、内径厚度和茎秆干物质转移率均明显降低,而外径厚度、茎秆鲜、干质量增加。相关分析表明,小麦实际倒伏率与基部第2节间外径大小、壁厚和茎秆充实度呈显著负相关,与株高、重心高度和基部节间长度呈显著正相关。在小麦实际生产中,茎秆基部节间株高和重心高度较低、内径小、茎壁较厚、干物质转移率低和节间充实度高是小麦茎秆抗倒伏能力强的具体体现。 	1.2不同抗倒伏能力小麦品种茎秆解剖结构特征 	通过对抗倒伏能力不同的6个小麦品种茎秆基部第2节间的解剖结构研究显示,小麦茎秆抗倒伏能力强的品种(济麦20和济麦22),其茎秆壁厚,机械组织细胞层数多而厚,大维管束数目多且面积大;抗倒伏能力较弱的品种(藁城8901和烟农21),其基部茎秆机械组织细胞层数较少且薄,大维管束数目少且面积小。相关分析表明,基部第2节间机械组织层数和厚度、大维管束数目和面积与小麦实际倒伏率均呈显著或极显著负相关。小麦茎秆基部第2节间机械组织层数多、茎壁厚、大维管束数目多且面积大,这些特征可能是选育抗倒伏小麦品种的重要指标。 	1.3不同抗倒伏能力小麦品种茎秆理化特性 	茎秆的理化特性与其抗倒性密切相关。茎秆中可溶性总糖及钾、氮的含量和基部节间抗折力对茎秆基部节间的抗倒伏指数和实际倒伏率均有显著影响。小麦实际倒伏率与其倒伏指数、基部抗折力、可溶性总糖和钾含量显著负相关,与基部节间氮含量显著正相关。 	不同小麦品种的茎秆木质素含量也存在明显差异。茎秆抗折力大、倒伏指数小的品种(济麦20和济麦22),其茎秆木质素含量高,苯丙氨酸转氨酶(PAL)、肉桂醇脱氢酶(CAD)、酪氨酸解氨酶(TAL)和4-香豆酸:CoA连接酶(4CL)活性强。相关分析表明,茎秆木质素含量与实际倒伏率呈显著负相关(r = -0.83, P{\textless}0.05);与抗折力呈显著正相关(r =0.86, P{\textless}0.05);PAL、TAL和CAD活性与木质素含量呈显著正相关(r =0.78、0.77、0.85, P{\textless}0.05),4CL活性与木质素含量呈不显著正相关(r =0.39, P{\textgreater}0.05)。研究表明,较高的PAL和CAD活性是木质素含量高的酶学基础,茎秆木质素含量可作为小麦品种抗倒伏性评价的一个重要指标。 	2栽培措施对小麦抗倒伏性的调控 	2.1种植密度与小麦抗倒伏性的关系 	随种植密度的增加,小麦茎秆高度和重心高度升高,茎秆基部节间变细长,茎壁变薄,基部第(1+2)节间占总长的比例增大,基部节间比茎重降低,小麦倒伏现象严重。说明在小麦生产中,增加种植密度使株高增高、节间充实度降低是造成小麦倒伏的重要原因之一。 	随种植密度的增加,烟农21和藁城8901的基部第2节间机械组织层数减少、茎壁厚度降低,大维管束数目和面积也有不同程度的降低。采用合理的种植密度,建立合理的群体结构,促进茎秆机械组织发育,增加大维管束数目和面积,是实现壮秆,为高产抗倒群体的建立打下良好基础的前提。 	增加种植密度在一定程度上降低了基部茎秆中氮、钾元素含量,并降低基部节间茎秆中可溶性总糖和淀粉含量,进而影响基部茎秆的抗折力和抗倒伏指数。 	增加种植密度使基部第2节间中的木质素含量及其合成相关酶(PAL、TAL、4CL和CAD)活性明显降低,进而导致小麦茎秆抗倒伏能力下降。 	2.2氮肥和多效唑与小麦抗倒伏性的关系 	氮肥施用量显著影响小麦茎秆抗倒伏能力。与低施氮(225 kg·hm-2)处理相比,高施氮(300 kg·hm-2)处理的茎秆高度、基部节间长度和基部(1+2)节间占总茎长的比例均增加,而基部节间粗度、节间充实度降低。喷施多效唑后,小麦基部节间缩短,基部第(1+2)节间占总茎长的比例降低,基部茎增粗,茎壁增厚,茎秆高度降低,重心位置下移,基部茎秆单位长度内干物质重量提高,小麦的抗倒伏能力增强。表明起身期叶面喷洒多效唑,对于解决高产麦田生育后期倒伏问题具有重要意义。 	与低施氮(225 kg·hm-2)处理相比,高施氮(300 kg·hm-2)处理使茎秆基部第2节间机械组织细胞层数减少,厚度变薄,大维管束数目和面积也减小。喷施多效唑使小麦茎秆基部第2节间的维管束数目和面积增加,机械组织层数增多,厚度增厚,小麦抗倒伏能力增强。 	与低施氮(225 kg·hm-2)处理相比,高施氮(300 kg·hm-2)处理降低了茎秆基部节间中可溶性总糖、淀粉和钾含量,而氮含量增加,氮/钾比值增大,导致基部茎秆抗折力和抗倒伏指数下降,增加倒伏风险。喷施多效唑则增加了茎秆基部节间氮、钾含量,增加了淀粉和可溶性总糖含量,提高了基部茎秆抗折力和抗倒伏指数,减少倒伏面积。 	同品种条件下,与低施氮(225 kg·hm-2)处理相比,高施氮(300 kg·hm-2)处理降低了茎秆PAL、TAL、CAD和4CL的活性,茎秆木质素含量、抗折力和抗倒伏指数降低。而喷施多效唑显著提高茎秆PAL、TAL和CAD的活性,木质素含量、茎秆抗折力和抗倒伏指数提高,倒伏面积和倒伏程度降低。相关分析表明,茎秆抗倒伏指数与木质素含量呈显著正相关(R=0.61,P{\textless}0.05);木质素含量与PAL、TAL和CAD酶活性呈显著正相关,与4CL酶活性相关不显著。高施氮量处理降低了茎秆木质素合成相关酶的活性和木质素含量,茎秆抗倒伏能力降低。施用多效唑显著提高茎秆木质素合成相关酶的活性和木质素含量,进而增强了茎秆抗倒伏能力,这是施用多效唑增强小麦抗倒伏性的生理机制之一。},

	abstract = {基因型、环境条件和管理措施等的交互作用,使得作物表型非常复杂。现代育种技术需要有批量育种小区作物表型参数的动态化和定量化分析的支持,而高通量表型监测是满足这一需求的关键技术。基于图像获取与分析技术构建具有较大通用性的作物表型信息自动化获取平台,可高效地量化表型参数用于优势基因型选育。对温室和大田环境下多种作物的生长过程进行图像数据采集,基于多源图像的解译,开发了在不同尺度上提取作物表型参数的高通量表型技术。主要内容如下:1.将多视角图像序列方法用于温室小麦早期活力参数的获取。选择苗期表型差异显著的两个基因型小麦进行了温室实验,从出苗到主茎长出第六叶,使用"绿光敏感"相机对定株观测的小麦个体进行多视角图像采集。采用多视角立体重建和运动到结构(MVS-FSM)的算法,从二维图像数据中重建三维结构点云,由此提取用于描述小麦苗期早期活力的多种表型参数(分蘖数、叶片数、株高、Haun系数、叶热间隔以及叶片长度、角度和生长速率)。结果表明,这两个基因型小麦的叶长提取值与实测值之间均呈现较高的相关性。进行两个基因型之间的差异比较可知,在小麦苗期生长阶段,两个不同基因型的表型参数提取值具有明显的差异,这与由传统方法获得的结果相一致。2.将图像信息解译的方法用于大田尺度的作物冠层参数定量化。基于无人机搭载RGB相机的监测平台分别获取棉花、高粱和甘蔗冠层的图像数据,进而构建两种分别基于无畸变图像数据和正交拼接图像的小区尺度覆盖度估测模型。使用一个高精度的植被像素分割算法计算每个小区的覆盖度。当目标小区处在无畸变图像中心的位置时,来自于正交拼接图像和无畸变图像的覆盖度计算值之间具有很好的相关性(棉花:R{\textasciitilde}2 = 0.97;高粱:R{\textasciitilde}2 = 0.98;甘蔗:R{\textasciitilde}2 = 0.84)。虽然对于同一目标小区基于无畸变图像的覆盖度计算值的取值范围较大,但是这种再投影算法为大田小区尺度覆盖度的估测提供了一种更为准确的方法。3.将多光谱图像数据用于大田尺度小麦全生育期归一化植被指数(NDVI)的动态监测。基于无人机搭载多光谱相机(RedEdge)的监测平台,获取了小麦全生育期的多光谱图像数据。基于正交拼接图像的小区尺度的分割结果,将小区内每个像素点的红波波段与近红外波段的反射比来计算其对应的NDVI值。无人机平台提取的NDVI值平均要比手持传感器GreenSeeker测量值高出0.2个单位,但两者之间具有较好的相关性(R{\textasciitilde}2 = 0.85)。基于监测结果评估了多个基因型小麦NDVI在不同处理小区之间的变异。基于全生育期小麦NDVI的计算值可知,其值在开花期前后达到最大。小区开花期NDVI值与其最终产量具有较强的相关性(R{\textasciitilde}2= 0.82);将由高分辨率图像计算的覆盖度作为目标小区像素点筛选的阈值,进而对NDVI的计算值进行校正,可以提高NDVI计算值与产量之间相关性。多视角图像法能够精确高效地量化代表小麦早期活力的多种表型参数。所开发的大田小区尺度的图像数据挖掘算法可被推广到其它形式的图像数据(热相机、多光谱相机等),从而为多源图像数据的解译与信息融合分析提供技术支撑。同时,基于无人机平台的近地遥感数据与地面采集样本数据的融合分析,不仅一定程度上可提高低分辨率图像数据解译结果的准确性,也为图像数据的多尺度分析提供技术支撑。因此,在温室和大田环境下,基于多源图像解译的高通量表型技术可以准确地监测多种作物生长状态,实现作物多种表型参数的动态分析。这为农业生产实践中优势基因选育提供强有力的技术支撑,也是精准农业、智慧农业发展中多学科交叉应用的结合点之一。},

	abstract = {作物群体是履行光合作用和物质生产职能的组织体系,其形态结构对光截获能力、冠层光合效率以及作物产量均具有重要影响,作物群体形态特征一直是人类认识、分析和评价作物的最基本方式。然而,作物群体形态结构复杂,空间分布规律性差、各器官表面结构变异性强,群体间存在大量器官的遮挡、交叉与相互作用,其形态结构不是简单单株复制的物理过程。传统农业对于作物群体形态结构的研究以经验型人工测量实验为主,其难以精确刻画作物群体因品种、种植密度和人工管理措施因素带来的形态结构差异。因此,综合运用计算机图形学、统计学、农学的技术和方法,以数字化、可视化的方式对作物群体形态结构进行快速、准确的解析研究具有重要的现实意义。玉米是我国最重要的粮食作物之一,增产潜力巨大;同时玉米植株高大,群体形态结构相对简单,易于描述和研究。针对玉米株型冠层三维数字化和结构解析研究中存在的问题,借助三维信息获取手段,重点开展玉米表型参数提取、玉米器官三维资源库构建、玉米群体三维建模、玉米器官网格简化和作物冠层冠隙分数计算方法研究,并应用这些方法对玉米株型和冠层结构进行评价。论文主要工作和创新点如下:1.基于三维数据的玉米表型参数提取。针对玉米株型参数手工测量标准不一致、误差大,基于图像和三维点云提取的株型参数无法满足玉米三维建模精度的问题。利用三维数字化仪获取玉米植株三维骨架结构数据,整合农学中对株型参数的定义,提取玉米主要株型参数,包括株高、叶倾角、方位角、叶长等。通过求解距离植株各叶片方位角角度差之和最小的平面角得到精确的玉米植株方位平面,并提出描述方位角偏离程度的dev值作为评价植株紧凑性指标。基于三维数字化提取的玉米株型参数可精确反映玉米品种和因栽培处理等因素产生的形态差异,并可用于玉米形态结构的三维模型构建。通过计算玉米果穗三维点云的法向信息,对点云进行收缩变换和欧式聚类,实现了玉米果穗点云的籽粒级分割,为基于三维数据的果穗考种提供了技术支持。2.玉米器官三维模板资源库构建。针对玉米植株及群体三维建模缺乏高精度器官三维模板支持的问题,提出基于实测数据的玉米器官三维模板资源库构建方法。对玉米植株进行结构单元划分,从三维数据获取方式角度制定玉米主要器官三维数据获取规范以保证资源库的准入规则。按该规范开展玉米主要器官三维数据获取,并基于实测数据,结合基于点云的三维重建和植物参数化几何建模方法构建各器官几何模型,最后,以所构建的玉米器官几何模型为内容,按可视化属性和农学属性两类关键字构建玉米器官三维模板资源库。3.提出基于t分布的玉米群体三维模型构建方法。为利用少量实测数据构建能够反映玉米群体因品种、环境条件、管理栽培措施等因素产生形态结构差异的几何模型,通过实测数据构建植株尺度和器官尺度株型参数的t分布函数,在其约束下生成群体内各植株株型参数,通过构造株型参数相似性度量函数从玉米器官三维模板库中调用对应器官几何模板,并结合人工交互或图像提取的各植株生长位置与植株方位平面角两组群体结构信息生成玉米群体几何模型。提出了基于二次误差测度边折叠和基于Laplacian光顺算子的玉米器官网格简化与优化方法,为进一步的玉米群体可视化计算分析提供了高质量的网格模型。4.提出基于多分辨率细分半球的作物冠层冠隙分数计算方法。针对作物冠层冠隙分数计算中因半球划分面积不均匀导致计算误差大的问题,利用(?)细分和Butterfly细分方法构造多分辨率细分半球,面元最大最小面积比最大为1.215,且面元多接近于正三角形、具有极高的相似性,结合Turtle模型原理实现了玉米冠层冠隙分数的计算,方法利用各分辨率细分半球间的树形结构关系实现了面元遮挡的逐级快速检测。最后分别从几何角度和散射光分布计算角度对方法进行了验证。作物冠层冠隙分数计算方法为作物群体结构分析、散射光分布计算和光截获总量模拟提供了关键技术支持。5.基于作物冠层光分布的玉米株型评价。整合玉米群体三维模型构建方法、作物群体冠隙分数计算方法,结合作物冠层直射光分布和散射光分布计算方法,提出了作物冠层瞬时光分布和光截获总量计算方法。在此基础上对多个玉米品种的株型和光截获能力进行精准化、数字化评价。该研究致力于玉米株型冠层形态结构数字化解析框架的构建,为玉米品种生产力评价、玉米高产机理解析、玉米品种耐密性鉴定等研究提供数字化、可视化的技术手段。},

	abstract = {虚拟植物的研究是以植物个体或群落为研究对象,以植物的形态发生为目标,对植物的生长发育过程进行模拟仿真的过程,而针对虚拟植物的系统建模和仿真是目前管理科学和工程学科一个重要的研究方向。近年来,虚拟植物的研究逐渐成为集植物学、农学、计算机图形学、信息科学、应用数学和可视化技术等多学科交叉的热门研究领域。虚拟植物模型是进行虚拟植物研究和应用的基础和关键,它一方面是从经验出发,对植物的形态结构、生理生态过程等进行抽象描述;另一方面则是运用数理方法对植物的生长发育过程进行定性或定量分析,从植物的拓扑结构和几何形态的发生、发育规律到植物结构与功能的互反馈机制以及受基因调控的植物表型构成,进行计算机可视化的过程。而利用先进的计算理论和技术,对植物生长发育过程进行定性和定量分析,并建立相应的数学模型,不仅可以为系统生物学的计算模型和可视化提供支撑,且在一定程度上可以预测和指导农林业的生产。本文的研究是在参与导师主持的山东省自主创新专项项目(项目号:2006ZZ10)中受到启发开始的,最初进行了分形植物的计算机可视化模拟研究。后来受到加拿大Calgary大学P.Prusinkiewicz研究团队的影响,基于L-系统开始系统性地对虚拟植物模型进行研究。同时,受冯献忠教授领导的山东省系统生物学重点实验室支持,为有效地开发和利用生物学数据,进行植物叶片图像的特征提取和分析,并构建植物的三维几何模型和实现计算机可视化。经过多年的研究,在阅读大量文献的基础上,从植物的分形模型、植物器官模型到完整的植物形态构成,基于广义L-系统的植物形态发生模型,并结合基因表达式编程思想,提出一种自适应的植物形态智能进化模型。因此,通过对植物表型不同生长机理的研究,努力从系统性的观点构建虚拟植物模型,在满足植物最佳株型设计要求的同时,最终建立具有物理意义明确、结构简洁条理、易于理解和编程实现的虚拟植物计算模型并进行计算机可视化,以便能够在一定程度上预测和指导农作物的生产,支持精准农业的研究和应用。经过长期深入的研究,达到了预期的目的,取得了理想的结果,本文的主要研究内容包括以下几个部分:1.从植物生长表现出的自相似性特征出发,基于分形几何理论,提出了一种植物表型的分形量化生长模型,作为快速构建植物形态发生的一种重要途径。自然界中的植物在一定尺度下表现为一个多级的自相似系统,在形态构成、植物分布以及生长过程中所表现出来的分形特征,很难用线性的、光滑的观点II去认识和研究,具有复杂性、非线性等特点。而分形植物的建模和仿真过程大多采用递归或迭代的方法来实现,从分形植物形态发生的算法复杂性分析来看,则那些具有分形特征的植物是简单的。因此,本着将复杂问题简单化的基本原理,基于分形几何理论,在深入研究植物的分形特征表现以及分形植物的重构方法后,提出一种便于计算机实现的分形植物量化模型,从而为植物的分类和识别、环境对植物的影响力分析等问题的求解提供了一个崭新的手段和视角。2.侧重于应用,基于图像特征分析与表示,提出利用改进的Snake模型提取和计算植物的叶片特征,并以此为约束,进行大豆叶片的三维重构。这部分工作的基础是图片文件预处理和图像特征的分析表示,主要包括两方面:(1)植物叶片特征的处理和分析:一是在RGB颜色空间上,通过对叶片图像的灰度化、二值化等处理,利用经典的图像处理算法完成植物标本叶片图像特征的提取和计算;二是基于HSI颜色模型,对具有复杂背景的植物叶片彩色图像,通过Harris算子进行角点特征的提取,在此基础上利用改进的Snake模型算法进行植物叶片的轮廓拟合,基于链码法求解相应的生物量,如叶面积、周长、叶长宽比等。(2)植物叶片的三维重构和变换:以获取的生物量计算结果为约束,基于B-样条曲线、曲面对叶片轮廓进行拟合插值,以Hausdorff距离对拟合误差进行评判,并通过节点插补算法对叶片轮廓进行调整,以特征点匹配为目标,使得叶片轮廓的插值拟合达到最优程度。最终,构建植物叶片的三维可视化模型,并实现在三维空间上的自由变换。仿真结果也表明,基于图像特征的计算分析和三维重构是进行生物学形态建模的一种非常有效的方法,是自动构建植物动态模型系统的重要组成部分。3.拓展L-系统的仿真计算功能,融合结构-功能模型,提出了一种广义L-系统模型,并对L-系统的建模能力进行了分析和讨论。基于L-系统的虚拟植物建模方法,最初是一种主要针对分形植物的描述性经验模型,目前已向着融合植物生长机理的动态解释性模型方法转变。因此,本文从L-系统的定义和构成出发,从植物的分枝模式、几何形态、生长机制以及植物与外部环境的交互等四个方面,对L-系统的植物建模仿真计算能力进行深入研究,从而提出一种广义L-系统模型。该模型将植物的生长发育抽象为一种多层次的、结构可变的动态功能转换系统。首先,基于构筑原理,由分枝节点的位置信息决定分枝模式,建立植物分枝结构的描述性经验模型,并基于双三次B样条细分的多分辨率曲线方法构建分枝的几何形态;其次,引入分枝轴的生物力学机制,基于反应-扩散-对流方程,构建植物的功能性分枝模式;最终,融合植物器官的建模方法,并考虑植物与环境的交互,符合植物生长的结构-功能建模要求,按照Markov过程的状态转移策略,以微分海龟几何为基础,构建虚拟植物的动态可视化物理模型,以满足一般植物的建模要求。该模型的提出,改进了L-系统对虚拟植物的建模仿真功能,拓宽了L-系统的应用领域,也为与其他模型的结合奠定了基础。4.为建立生物学和形态建模之间沟通的有效机制,更好地开发和利用生物学数据,应用数字命名代码系统,提出一种基于L-系统的大豆分枝形态量化模型。该部分从生物学实验数据出发,以功能-结构原理为基础,以管道模型理论为指导,以大豆作为模式植物,通过非线性回归分析,在获取大豆株高的经验模型及株高的分布区间后,使用锥形茎和S-曲线方程完成大豆主茎、分枝和分节的量化计算,并应用数字命名代码系统提出一种基于L-系统的大豆分枝形态量化模型,这是构建植物形态发生智能进化模型的基础。5.满足植物表型多样性、可塑性的特点,基于基因表达式编程思想和广义L-系统模型,提出一种自适应的虚拟植物形态发生智能进化模型。该部分基于基因表达式编程思想和广义L-系统,在形态量化计算的基础上,提出一种自适应的植物形态发生智能进化模型,不仅可以减少建模过程中的人工干预,自动获取模型参数,快速构建植物形态进化过程中的初始种群,提高算法的搜索效率;而且结合聚类分析原理的个体适应度评价函数计算,能够自动筛选出每一代中的优良个体,以满足植物表型多样性、可塑性等的要求,为植物最佳株型的自动设计注入活力。同时也为辅助决策系统生物学建模、分析和计算等诸多方面提供了一种新的计算思维和模式。在长期研究工作的基础上,为能够系统地、全面地构建完整的植物表型,本文从自然植物的分形现象出发,按照生物学建模方法,忠实于实际的植物生长机理,分别对植物的器官模型、实验数据的量化模型、计算机可视化模型等展开研究,并进一步探讨了植物表型的智能进化模型。这些研究成果,也必将为后续工作中植物表型受基因调控的研究提供有力的支撑。},

首先，在试验观测的基础上，分析了水稻叶片平面形态特征、叶角动态变化规律、叶长叶宽关系以及主茎与分蘖同伸叶片的长度关系。结果表明：叶片宽度随叶长方向可用二次方程进行拟合；叶角随叶龄发育可分四个变化阶段；叶长与叶宽的关系可用幂指数函数描述，不同品种类型水稻分蘖与主茎同伸叶片的叶长比随分蘖叶序呈二次曲线变化。进一步利用上述关系与主茎分蘖叶片同伸原理，耦合水稻叶龄、叶面积和茎蘖数模拟模型，构建了预测水稻叶片几何参数(叶长、叶宽)的动态模型。利用实测资料对模型的初步检验表明，叶片几何参数分析模型可较好地模拟不同生长条件下水稻不同叶位叶片的几何参数。
通过对水稻叶片的受力分析，推导了叶曲线方程，在对其影响系数进行参数化处理的基础上，进行了方程求解。叶曲线方程的灵敏度分析显示，方程较好地体现了叶长、叶宽、叶形、比叶重和叶片形变系数等参数对叶脉空间形态的综合影响，与生产中水稻株型特征变化相一致。利用三维数字化仪获得的不同品种类型水稻拔节期和孕穗期叶脉空间坐标试验数据对叶曲线方程进行了模拟分析，表明叶曲线方程可以合理而可靠地定量描述水稻叶曲线特征的动态变化规律。
根据试验资料，分析了水稻茎秆节间长度、粗度的变化规律以及主茎与分蘖叶鞘长、茎秆长的关系。结果表明，相对节间长度随伸长节间的变化规律可用幂指数方程描述，节间粗度随伸长节间数呈二次方程变化，分蘖与主茎同伸叶鞘长度比随分蘖叶序呈二次曲线变化。在此基础上，进一步结合生长模型株高、叶龄等输出，构建了叶鞘长度、节间长度的形态建成模型，并利用试验资料对模型进行了可靠性检验。
在连续观察不同品种和不同施氮条件下水稻穗结构的基础上，对水稻穗结构的特征进行了定量分析及参数化处理。结果表明：一次枝梗长与穗长之比随穗轴节位呈两次函数变化，不同品种类型之间的参数变异较大；一次枝梗上的二次枝梗数与一次枝梗长度呈线性变化；一次枝梗基本均匀着生于穗轴上，一次枝梗和二次枝梗的节间距离变化不大。进一步利用水稻生长模型输出的穗粒数和一次枝梗数分析了二次枝梗的空间分布；根据穗轴受力平衡原理，推导了穗轴空间形态曲线。并利用利用试验资料对模型进行了初步检验。
根据对文献资料的综合分析，明确了水稻种子根与各节位不定根的发根时间、数量、伸长速度、伸展方向等基本特征及影响因子，进一步提出了根系生长特征及根系构型的定量模拟方法，并初步实现了水稻根系生长的虚拟表达。
在不同器官形态建模的基础上，以节间及其着生叶或穗为单位，将整个水稻植株分解成若干生长单元，来描述水稻植株的冠层拓扑结构；利用Logistic曲线模拟器官伸长过程；进一步根据器官伸长与叶龄发育的对应关系，结合生长模型输出的累积生长度日，确定了各器官的初始伸长时间和伸长历期，构建了水稻植株冠层结构动态模型，并对模型进行了初步检验。
最后，运用虚拟植物中常用的L系统方法，结合水稻器官、植株和冠层的形态特征，提取了水稻植株、根、穗结构的L系统规则，并实现了水稻植株生长的虚拟表达。进一步根据主茎叶龄、分蘖数、相同位置器官几何参数的差异，初步提出了虚拟水稻冠层的实现方法。},

	abstract = {虚拟作物以作物器官、个体或群体的形态结构为研究对象,在计算机上以可视化方式模拟作物在三维空间中的形态结构变化规律及生长发育过程,是对作物生长模拟的进一步深化和拓展,在农学研究和教学、作物生长设计和管理调控等领域具有重要的现实意义和广泛的应用前景。本研究的目的是融合作物学、计算机图形学、虚拟现实等多学科的理论与技术,以小麦、水稻作物为对象,基于作物形态建成模拟模型,研究作物形态建模、真实感绘制、器官变形模拟、作物个体和群体冠层三维重建及作物可视化中的器官碰撞检测与响应等关键技术,进而建立基于模型耦合的作物生长可视化系统,为进一步构建基于模型的数字作物系统奠定技术基础。
首先,将参数化几何建模方法应用于作物器官形态建模,通过对稻麦作物器官形态建成过程中关键特征的观测分析,利用三维几何建模技术,构建了基于形态特征参数的作物器官几何模型,包括叶片、叶鞘、茎秆、麦穗和稻穗几何模型。用NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline)曲面分别对叶片和叶鞘建模,并用圆柱体模拟茎秆的节间。采用组合单器官的方式来构建麦穗模型：用圆柱体模拟穗轴,用椭球体和圆柱体分别模拟小穗的籽粒及小穗枝梗。用Bezier曲线来拟合稻穗曲线,将二维空间的穗曲线映射到三维空间,构建穗轴几何模型；用一段穗轴及圆柱体模拟一次枝梗和二次枝梗,并分别用椭球体及圆柱体模拟小穗的谷粒及小枝梗,进一步形成具有拓扑关系的稻穗几何模型。将叶长、叶宽、茎叶夹角、叶鞘长、节间长、节间粗、穗长、穗倾角等设为作物器官几何模型的基本参数,能较好地描述作物器官形态建成过程,参数的生物学意义明确,且容易与作物形态建成过程模型相耦合,为实现作物虚拟生长奠定了基础。
以作物器官几何模型为基础,结合纹理映射、颜色渲染、光照处理等真实感图形显示技术,实现了具有较强真实感的作物器官图形显示。并进一步针对作物器官的变形问题,尝试将骨架驱动物体变形的方法应用于作物器官的局部变形,对叶片的弯曲、扭曲等变形问题做了初步的探讨,提出了一种骨架驱动的叶片变形方法。该方法首先生成叶片骨架模型,包括主脉骨架和若干条垂直于主脉骨架的横向骨架；然后驱动骨架模型发生变形,并根据变形后的叶片骨架将变形操作应用到叶片曲面上,进而实现叶片曲面变形。最后,应用骨架驱动的叶片变形方法,分别对小麦叶片曲面进行弯曲和扭曲变形模拟。实验结果表明,基于骨架驱动的作物叶片形变方法能灵活控制叶片弯曲和扭曲程度,从而获得自然的叶片曲面变形效果。
针对现有植物生长建模方法难以应用于作物可视化的问题,提出了一种利用树形结构将作物器官可视化模型与作物形态建成模拟模型有机结合,显示作物个体生长过程的方法。该方法首先基于作物个体生长的基本规律,利用作物形态建成模拟模型的输出参数建立能描述作物生长信息(包括器官几何结构信息和植株生长拓扑特征)的作物树；然后按生长发育的时间序列层次遍历作物树,获得作物生长的相关信息,并基于器官可视化模型,实现作物个体生长的可视化.实验结果表明,所形成的可视化方法能较准确表现作物生长过程中的器官几何信息和拓扑特征,较真实地反映作物形态的动态生长过程,为实现作物群体生长的可视化提供了关键技术。
提出了一种基于网格简化技术和细节层次技术实现作物群体生长实时绘制的方法。首先根据作物群体形态建成规律及群体生长过程中个体之间的差异,将网格简化技术与基于视点的细节层次控制技术相结合,根据作物器官几何模型的构建方法生成不同细节层次的作物个体模型；然后利用作物群体形态特性,根据视角和视距来指导空间的剖分以及细节层次的选择,分别调用具有不同细节的模型参与群体的生成,建立基于多细节层次模型的作物群体显示算法；最后在作物个体生长可视化的基础上,实现作物群体的实时绘制。实验结果表明,提出的群体可视化技术能较准确表现作物生长过程中的群体形态特征,具有较好的真实感和实时性,为进一步建立虚拟作物系统奠定了基础.
将碰撞检测与响应技术引入作物可视化生长模拟,针对以NURBS曲面表示的作物叶片,提出了一种基于曲面分割技术及混合层次包围盒树实现作物叶片间碰撞检测的方法。该方法首先采用节点插入技术对叶片曲面进行分割,然后兼顾碰撞检测的速度与精度,为分割后的叶片曲面建立轴向包围盒AABB(Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)与固定方向凸包FDH (Fixed Direction Hull)混合层次包围盒树。根结点采用AABB包围盒,以快速排除不可能相交的叶片,其它层结点采用FDH包围盒,以保证精确的判定距离较近的叶片间碰撞状态,并基于混合层次包围盒树,设计了碰撞检测算法。在此基础上,针对不同的叶片间碰撞情况,根据作物叶片形态变化规律,提出了较合理有效的冲突响应机制.实例分析表明,所建立的算法可有效地应用于作物群体可视化生长的仿真实现,对于提高虚拟作物的精度及效果具有重要意义。
最后,在气象因子、土壤条件、品种参数和栽培措施等基础数据的支持下,通过耦合作物形态建成模拟模型和作物生长可视化模型,以Visual C++. net语言为设计工具,使用OpenGL图形平台和Access数据库,采用组件化技术构建了基于模型的作物生长可视化系统.该系统初步实现了不同生态环境和生产技术条件下作物生长过程的动态模拟和逼真显示,从器官-个体-群体三个层次达到了作物形态生长的可视化。系统的开发和应用将有助于提升作物生长系统表达的数字化和可视化水平,促进虚拟农作技术的发展。},

	abstract = {Productivity stabilization is an important issue facing plant factories. As such, researchers have been investigating growth prediction with the overall goal of improving productivity. The projected area of a plant (PA) is usually used for growth prediction, by which the growth of a plant is estimated by observing the overall approximate movement of the plant. To overcome this problem, we focused on the time-series movement of plant leaves, using the optical flow (OF) analysis to acquire this information for a lettuce. OF analysis is an image processing method that extracts difference between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of the subject. Experiments were carried out at a commercial large-scale plant factory. By using a microcomputer with a camera module placed above the lettuce seedlings, images of 338 seedlings were taken every 20 min over 9 days (from the 6th to the 15th day after sowing). Then, the features of the leaf movement were extracted from the image by calculating the normal-vector in the OF analysis. These features were applied to machine learning to predict the fresh weight of the lettuce at harvest time (38 days after sowing). The growth prediction model using the features extracted from the OF analysis was found to perform well with a correlation ratio of 0.743. Furthermore, this study also considered a phenotyping system that was capable of automatically analyzing a plant image, which would allow this growth prediction model to be widely used in commercial plant factories.},

	abstract = {Low-cost unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a promising platform for remote-sensing data acquisition to satisfy the needs of wide range of applications. Utilizing UAVs, which are equipped with directly georeferenced RGB-frame cameras and hyperspectral push-broom scanners, for precision agriculture and high-throughput phenotyping is an important application that is gaining significant attention from researchers in the mapping and plant science fields. The advantages of UAVs as mobile-mapping platforms include low cost, ease of storage and deployment, ability to fly lower and collect high-resolution data, and filling an important gap between wheel-based and manned-airborne platforms. However, limited endurance and payload are the main disadvantages of consumer-grade UAVs. These limitations lead to the adoption of low-quality direct georeferencing and imaging systems, which in turn will impact the quality of the delivered products. Thanks to recent advances in sensor calibration and automated triangulation, accurate mapping using low-cost frame imaging systems equipped with consumer-grade georeferencing units is feasible. Unfortunately, the quality of derived geospatial information from push-broom scanners is quite sensitive to the performance of the implemented direct georeferencing unit. This paper presents an approach for improving the orthorectification of hyperspectral push-broom scanner imagery with the help of generated orthophotos from frame cameras using tie point and linear features, while modeling the impact of residual artifacts in the direct georeferencing information. The performance of the proposed approach has been verified through real datasets that have been collected by quadcopter and fixed-wing UAVs over an agricultural field.},

Nevertheless, an automated interpretation and, finally, the segmentation into functional groups are still difficult to achieve. Two barley plants were scanned in a time course, and the organs were separated by applying a histogram-based classification algorithm. The leaf organs were represented by meshing algorithms, while the stem organs were parameterized by a least-squares cylinder approximation. We introduced surface feature histograms with an accuracy of 96\% for the separation of the barley organs, leaf and stem. This enables growth monitoring in a time course for barley plants. Its reliability was demonstrated by a comparison with manually fitted parameters with a correlation R2 = 0:99 for the leaf area and R2 = 0:98 for the cumulated stem height. A proof of concept has been given for its applicability for the detection of water stress in barley, where the extension growth of an irrigated and a non-irrigated plant has been monitored.},

	abstract = {The study of plant development requires increasingly powerful modeling tools to help understand and simulate the growth and functioning of plants. In the last decade, the formalism of L-systems has emerged as a major paradigm for modeling plant development. Previous implementations of this formalism were made based on static languages, i.e. languages that require explicit definition of variable types before using them. These languages are often efficient but involve quite a lot of syntactic overhead, thus restricting the flexibility of use for modelers. In this work, we present an adaptation of L-systems to the Python language, a popular and powerful open-license dynamic language. We show that the use of dynamic language properties makes it possible to enhance the development of plant growth models: i) by keeping a simple syntax while allowing for high-level programming constructs, ii) by making code execution easy and avoiding compilation overhead iii) allowing a high level of model reusability and the building of complex modular models iv) and by providing powerful solutions to integrate MTG data-structures (that are a common way to represent plants at several scales) into L-systems and thus enabling to use a wide spectrum of computer tools based on MTGs developed for plant architecture. We then illustrate the use of L-Py in real applications to build complex models or to teach plant modeling in the classroom.},

This method is derived from the two-surface method introduced in the 90s to estimate the fractal dimension of tree species from field measurements on collections of trees. Here we adapted the method to individual plants. The multiscale topology and geometry of the plant must first be digitized in 3D. Then leafy branching systems of different sizes are constructed from the plant database, using the topological information. 3D convex envelops are then computed for each leafy branching system. The fractal dimension of the plant is finally estimated by comparing the total leaf area and the convex envelop area of these leafy modules. The method was assessed on a set of four peach trees entirely digitized at shoot scale. Results show that the peach trees have a marked self-similar foliage with fractal dimension close to 2.4.},

Construction of three-dimensional (3D) models of plants and acquisition of their spatial information is an effective method for obtaining plant structural parameters.

First, for the initial segmentation, leave images were viewed from the top, then leaves in the top-view images were segmented using distance transform and the watershed algorithm. Next, the images of leaves after the initial segmentation were reduced by 90\%, and the seed regions for each leaf were produced. The seed region was re-projected onto the 3D images, and each leaf was segmented by expanding the seed region with the 3D information. After leaf segmentation, the leaf area of each leaf and its inclination angle were estimated accurately via a voxel-based calculation. As a result, leaf area and leaf inclination angle were estimated accurately after automatic leaf segmentation. This method for automatic plant structure analysis allows accurate and efficient plant breeding and growth management.},

The SR attainable through the proposed algorithm can increase the precision of 3-D reconstruction from UAV images, enabling the production of high-resolution images for constructing high-frequency time series and for high-precision digital mapping in agriculture. The basic idea of the proposed method is to use a field server or ground-based camera to take training images and then construct multiple pairs of dictionaries based on selective sparse representations to reduce instability during the sparse coding process. The dictionaries are classified on the basis of the edge orientation into five clusters: 0, 45, 90, 135, and nondirection. The proposed method is expected to reduce blurring, blocking, and ringing artifacts especially in edge areas. We evaluated the proposed and previous methods using peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, feature similarity, and computation time. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms based on qualitative and quantitative analysis. In the end, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to increase the precision of 3-D reconstruction from UAV images.},

Extending pre-trained models to perform yield estimation for a completely new type of fruit is even more challenging, but interesting since this situation is typical in practice. In this work, we combine a State-of-the-Art weakly-supervised fruit counting model with an unsupervised style transfer method for addressing the task above. In this sense, our proposed approach is quasi-unsupervised. In particular, we use a Cycle-Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation and train it alongside with a Presence-Absence Classifier (PAC) that discriminates images containing fruits or not. The PAC produces the weak-supervision signal for the counting network, that can then be used on the target orchard directly. Experiments on datasets collected in four different orchards show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the supervised baseline methods.},

Whether crop architectures in current elite crop cultivars can be modified for increased canopy CO2 uptake rate (Ac) under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Ca) is currently unknown. To study this question, we developed a new model of canopy photosynthesis, which includes three components: (i) a canopy architectural model; (ii) a forward ray tracing algorithm; and (iii) a steady-state biochemical model of C3 photosynthesis. With this model, we demonstrated that the Ac estimated from ‘average’ canopy light conditions is {\textasciitilde}25\% higher than that from light conditions at individual points in the canopy. We also evaluated theoretically the influence of canopy architectural on Ac under current and future Ca in rice. Simulation results suggest that to gain an optimal Ac for the examined rice cultivar, the stem height, leaf width and leaf angles can be manipulated to enhance canopy photosynthesis. This model provides a framework for designing ideal crop architectures to gain optimal Ac under future changing climate conditions. A close linkage between canopy photosynthesis modelling and canopy photosynthesis measurements is required to fully realise the potential of such modelling approaches in guiding crop improvements.},

	abstract = {In our recent work [1], [2], we proposed Point Feature Histograms (PFH) as robust multi-dimensional features which describe the local geometry around a point p for 3D point cloud datasets. In this paper, we modify their mathematical expressions and perform a rigorous analysis on their robustness and complexity for the problem of 3D registration for overlapping point cloud views. More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence basin of a local non-linear optimizer: SAC-IA (SAmple Consensus Initial Alignment).},

	abstract = {Plant height can be used as an indicator to estimate crop phenology and biomass. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based point cloud data derived from photogrammetry methods contains the structural information of crops which could be used to retrieve crop height. However, removing noise and outliers from the UAV-based crop point cloud data for height extraction is challenging. The objective of this paper is to develop an alternative method for canopy height determination from UAV-based 3D point cloud datasets using a statistical analysis method and a moving cuboid filter to remove outliers. In this method, first, the point cloud data is divided into many 3D columns. Secondly, a moving cuboid filter is applied in each column and moved downward to eliminate noise points. The threshold of point numbers in the filter is calculated based on the distribution of points in the column. After applying the moving cuboid filter, the crop height is calculated from the highest and lowest points in each 3D column. The proposed method achieved high accuracy for height extraction with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.37 cm and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.07 cm. The canopy height monitoring window for winter wheat using this method starts from the beginning of the stem extension stage to the end of the heading stage (BBCH 31 to 65). Since the height of wheat has limited change after the heading stage, this method could be used to retrieve the crop height of winter wheat. In addition, this method only requires one operation of UAV in the field. It could be an effective method that can be widely used to help end-user to monitor their crops and support real-time decision making for farm management.},

	title = {Vision principles for harvest robotics : sowing artificial intelligence in agriculture},
	abstract = {The objective of this work was to further advance technology in agriculture, specifically by pursuing the research direction of agricultural robotics for harvesting in greenhouses, with the specific use-case of Capsicum annuum, also known as sweet or bell pepper. Within this scope, it was previously determined that the primary cause of agricultural robotics not yet maturing was the complexity of the tasks due to inherent variations of the crops, in turn limiting performance in harvest success and time. As a solution, it was suggested to further enhance robotic systems with sensing, world modelling and reasoning, for example by pursuing approaches like machine learning and visual servo control. In this work, we have followed this suggestion. It was identified that facilitating new levels of artificial intelligence in the domains of sensing and motion control would be one of the ways to improve upon classical mechanization. Specifically, we investigated the means of using machine learning based computer vision guided manipulation towards a basic form of world representation and autonomy. For this, in Chapter 2 we developed an eye-in-hand sensing and visual control framework for dense crops with the goal to overcome issues of occlusion and image registration that were previously introduced when sensing was performed externally from the robot manipulator. Additionally, simultaneous localization and mapping was investigated to aid in forming a world model. In Chapter 3 we aimed to reduce the requirement of annotating empirical images by providing a method to synthetically generate large sets of automatically annotated images as input for convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation models. An annotated dataset was created of 10,500 synthetic and 50 empirical images. In Chapter 4 we further investigated how synthetic images can be used to bootstrap CNNs for successful learning of empirical images. We provided computer vision in agriculture a pioneering machine learning based methodology for state-of-the-art plant part segmentation performance, whilst simultaneously reducing the reliance on labor intensive manual annotations. Chapter 5 explored applying a cycle consistent generative adversarial network to our dataset with the objective to generate more realistic synthetic images by translating them to the feature distribution of the empirical domain. We show that this approach can further improve segmentation performance whilst further reducing the requirement of annotated empirical images. In Chapter 6 we aimed to bring all previous chapters into practice. The objective was to estimate angles between fruit and stems from image segmentations to support visual servo control grasping in a sweet-pepper harvesting robot. Our approach calculated angles under unmodified greenhouse conditions that met the accuracy requirement of 25 degrees for 73\% of the cases. Combined, the work shows a promising stepping stone towards agricultural robotics which could ensure the quality of meals and nourishment of a growing population. Furthermore, it can become an important technology for societal issues in developed nations, e.g. by solving current labor problems. It can further improve upon the quality of life and contribute to reaching an exemplary equilibrium of sustainable agricultural production.},

Given this new era of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in this field.

We organize the literature based on the shape representations, the network architectures, and the training mechanisms they use. While this survey is intended for methods which reconstruct generic objects, we also review some of the recent works which focus on specific object classes such as human body shapes and faces.

            Association mapping studies have enabled researchers to identify candidate loci for many important environmental resistance factors, including agronomically relevant resistance traits in plants. However, traditional genome-by-environment studies such as these require a phenotyping pipeline which is capable of accurately and consistently measuring stress responses, typically in an automated high-throughput context using image processing. In this work, we present Latent Space Phenotyping (LSP), a novel phenotyping method which is able to automatically detect and quantify response to treatment directly from images. Using two synthetically generated image datasets, we first show that LSP is able to successfully recover the simulated QTL in both simple and complex synthetic imagery.

	abstract = {The compressional modulus of elasticity is an important mechanical property for understanding stalk lodging, but this property is rarely available for thin-walled plant stems such as maize and sorghum because excised tissue samples from these plants are highly susceptible to buckling. The purpose of this study was to develop a testing protocol that provides accurate and reliable measurements of the compressive modulus of elasticity of the rind of pith-filled plant stems. The general approach was to relying upon standard methods and practices as much as possible, while developing new techniques as necessary. Two methods were developed for measuring the compressional modulus of elasticity of pith-filled node–node specimens. Both methods had an average repeatability of ± 4\%. The use of natural plant morphology and architecture was used to avoid buckling failure. Both methods relied up on spherical compression platens to accommodate inaccuracies in sample preparation. The effect of sample position within the test fixture was quantified to ensure that sample placement did not introduce systematic errors. Reliable measurements of the compressive modulus of elasticity of pith-filled plant stems can be performed using the testing protocols presented in this study. Recommendations for future studies were also provided.},

	url = {https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/17587},
	abstract = {A rapidly increasing world population and changing climate means plant scientists will need to be able to efficiently develop crop varieties to feed the world. Although the technology for sequencing the genomes of plants has advanced, the technology for characterizing the physical traits of plants has remained relatively static. This gap in technology has become known as the “Phenotyping Bottleneck.” To close this gap, researchers are working to develop robotic systems that can efficiently recognize various physical traits of plants. The goal of this research was to investigate how the design requirements for a vehicle that interacts with a biological system are translated into a working mechanical system. The design requirements include the ability to traverse and image crops in 30-inch wide space between crop rows. This thesis reports the concepts, design decisions, and manufacturing process around the construction of such as a phenotyping robot namely Phenobot 3.0, which stands for the 3rd generation of our phenotyping robot series. Phenobot 3.0 is optimized for phenotyping maize plants in the field but can be adapted for phenotyping other crops. Specifically, Phenobot 3.0 is designed to be narrow to fit between the rows but also tall for sensor placement so that it can gather data from the emergence to the full height of maize plants. To achieve the needed stability of the sensors (LiDAR, stereo cameras), the robot employs a self-leveling mast to cope with the uneven terrain while ensuring proper sensor to plant placement. Unlike many other field-based phenotyping robots, Phenobot 3.0 employs a 4-wheel-drive articulated drivetrain that has differentials on each pair of wheels to ensure maximum steering efficiency and prolonged operational time in the field. Phenobot 3.0 will be a member of PhenoNet, a network of five robots for maize plant phenotyping under different growing environments, a project funded by the National Science Foundation. The scale of this project implies that each design requirement must be carefully evaluated so that the manufacturing process can be easily scaled up to produce multiple units. The results from the preliminary tests of the Phenobot 3.0 prototype have demonstrated satisfactory functionalities and expected performance metrics.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

The objectives of this study were to develop and test a new index, based on red, green and blue bands, that is sensitive to differences in leaf chlorophyll content at leaf and canopy scales. We propose the triangular greenness index (TGI), which calculates the area of a triangle with vertices: (λr, Rr), (λg, Rg), and (λb, Rb), where λ is the wavelength (nm) and R is the reflectance for bands in red (r), green (g), and blue (b) wavelengths. The TGI was correlated with chlorophyll content using a variety of leaf and plot reflectance data. Generally, indices using the chlorophyll red-edge (710–730 nm) had higher correlations with chlorophyll content compared to TGI. However, correlations between TGI and chlorophyll content were equal to or higher than broad-band indices, when leaf area index (LAI) was {\textgreater}2. Simulations using the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) canopy model indicate an interaction among TGI, LAI, and soil type at low LAI, whereas at high LAI, TGI was only affected by leaf chlorophyll content. The TGI could be used with low-cost sensors, such as commercially-available digital cameras, for N management by remote sensing.},

	abstract = {Approximately 3000 million ha of the world’s forests have been classified as productive, and are subject to some kind of management. Considering their environmental and social importance, the managed forest ecosystems are not receiving as much scientific attention as the few remaining unmanaged ones. This is especially true in the growing urban landscapes where managed forest ecosystems provide a range of important services. Most societies today demand integrated and wide-ranging approaches to forest management that address social, ecological, and economic goals. These demands can be met if simplistic philosophies and unverified doctrines are replaced by new paradigms that require a wider understanding of social demands and natural system dynamics. In theory, involving science directly in the management of a wooded ecosystem appears to be logical, but the practical implementation of this idea is not a trivial task. This paper presents a theoretical framework for the science-based management of a forested landscape that includes three key elements: forest design, research and demonstration and harvest event analysis. This framework is introduced, explained by means of examples, and supported by concrete evidence. The paper is based on an updated version of Gadow (2005), and it is not intended as a manifest, but as a contribution to a much-needed discussion about forest management as a scientific discipline.

	abstract = {Variable plot sampling has been widely used for many years. It was recognized, early in its application, that the process of getting stand volume could be divided into two components, counting trees to get basal area per unit area and measuring trees to get volume/basal area ratios (VBARs). It was further recognized that these two components had different amounts of variation and therefore should be sampled at different intensities. The fact that basal area per unit area is almost always more variable than the VBARs of individual trees has led to the widespread practice of counting trees on all plots and subsampling trees for VBAR measurements, typically by measuring all the trees on every third or fourth plot. This article presents an alternative, the "big BAF method," which uses a larger basal-area-factor angle gauge to do a second sweep of each plot to select the trees to be measured for VBAR. This procedure spreads the tree measurements throughout the stand and is thus more statistically efficient. The method is simple to apply, requires no additional computations, and is easy to audit. Two case-study examples are used to demonstrate the method.},

However, the literature is inconsistent and incomplete with respect to large-scale forest C estimation. We compiled all available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component biomass, defined in dry weight terms, for trees in the United States. We then implemented a modified meta-analysis based on the published equations to develop a set of consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for U.S. species. Equations for predicting biomass of tree components were developed as proportions of total aboveground biomass for hardwood and softwood groups. A comparison with recent equations used to develop large-scale biomass estimates from U.S. forest inventory data for eastern U.S. species suggests general agreement (?30\%) between biomass estimates. The comparison also shows that differences in equation forms and species groupings may cause differences at small scales depending on tree size and forest species composition. This analysis represents the first major effort to compile and analyze all available biomass literature in a consistent national-scale framework. The equations developed here are used to compute the biomass estimates used by the model FORCARB t o develop the U.S. C budget.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem management is management driven by explicit goals, executed by policies, protocols, and practices, and made adaptable by monitoring and research based on our best understanding of the ecological interactions and processes necessary to sustain ecosystem composition, structure, and function. In recent years, sustainability has become an explicitly stated, even legislatively mandated, goal of natural resource management agencies. In practice, however, management approaches have often focused on maximizing short-term yield and economic gain rather than long-term sustainability. Several obstacles contribute to this disparity, including: (1) inadequate information on the biological diversity of environments; (2) widespread ignorance of the function and dynamics of ecosystems; (3) the openness and interconnectedness of ecosystems on scales that transcend management boundaries; (4) a prevailing public perception that the immediate economic and social value of supposedly renewable resources outweighs the risk of future ecosystem damage or the benefits of alternative management approaches. The goal of ecosystem management is to overcome these obstacles. Ecosystem management includes the following elements: (1) Sustainability. Ecosystem management does not focus primarily on "deliverables" but rather regards intergenerational sustainability as a precondition. (2) Goals. Ecosystem management establishes measurable goals that specify future processes and outcomes necessary for sustainability. (3) Sound ecological models and understanding. Ecosystem management relies on research performed at all levels of ecological organization. (4) Complexity and connectedness. Ecosystem management recognizes that biological diversity and structural complexity strengthen ecosystems against disturbance and supply the genetic resources necessary to adapt to long-term change. (5) The dynamic character of ecosystems. Recognizing that change and evolution are inherent in ecosystem sustainability, ecosystem management avoids attempts to "freeze" ecosystems in a particular state or configuration. (6) Context and scale. Ecosystem processes operate over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and their behavior at any given location is greatly affected by surrounding systems. Thus, there is no single appropriate scale or time frame for management. (7) Humans as ecosystem components. Ecosystem management values the active role of humans in achieving sustainable management goals. (8) Adaptability and accountability. Ecosystem management acknowledges that current knowledge and paradigms of ecosystem function are provisional, incomplete, and subject to change. Management approaches must be viewed as hypotheses to be tested by research and monitoring programs. The following are fundamental scientific precepts for ecosystem management. (1) Spatial and temporal scale are critical. Ecosystem function includes inputs, outputs, cycling of materials and energy, and the interactions of organisms. Boundaries defined for the study or management of one process are often inappropriate for the study of others; thus, ecosystem management requires a broad view. (2) Ecosystem function depends on its structure, diversity, and integrity. Ecosystem management seeks to maintain biological diversity as a critical component in strengthening ecosystems against disturbance. Thus, management of biological diversity requires a broad perspective and recognition that the complexity and function of any particular location is influenced heavily by the surrounding system. (3) Ecosystems are dynamic in space and time. Ecosystem management is challenging in part because ecosystems are constantly changing. Over time scales of decades or centuries, many landscapes are altered by natural disturbances that lead to mosaics of successional patches of different ages. Such patch dynamics are critical to ecosystem structure and function. (4) Uncertainty, surprise, and limits to knowledge. Ecosystem management acknowledges that, given sufficient time and space, unlikely events are certain to occur. Adaptive management addresses this uncertainty by combining democratic principles, scientific analysis, education, and institutional learning to increase our understanding of ecosystem processes and the consequences of management interventions, and to improve the quality of data upon which decisions must be made. Ecosystem management requires application of ecological science to natural resource actions. Moving from concepts to practice is a daunting challenge and will require the following steps and actions. (1) Defining sustainable goals and objectives. Sustainable strategies for the provision of ecosystem goods and services cannot take as their starting points statements of need or want such as mandated timber supply, water demand, or arbitrarily set harvests of shrimp or fish. Rather, sustainability must be the primary objective, and levels of commodity and amenity provision must be adjusted to meet that goal. (2) Reconciling spatial scales. Implementation of ecosystem management would be greatly simplified if management jurisdictions were spatially congruent with the behavior of ecosystem processes. Given the variation in spatial domain among processes, one perfect fit for all processes is virtually impossible; rather, ecosystem management must seek consensus among the various stakeholders within each ecosystem. (3) Reconciling temporal scales. Whereas management agencies are often forced to make decisions on a fiscal-year basis, ecosystem management must deal with time scales that transcend human lifetimes. Ecosystem management requires long-term planning and commitment. (4) Making the system adaptable and accountable. Successful ecosystem management requires institutions that are adaptable to changes in ecosystem characteristics and in our knowledge base. Adaptive management by definition requires the scientist's ongoing interaction with managers and the public. Communication must flow in both directions, and scientists must be willing to prioritize their research with regard to critical management needs. Scientists have much to offer in the development of monitoring programs, particularly in creating sampling approaches, statistical analyses, and scientific models. As our knowledge base evolves, scientists must develop new mechanisms to communicate research and management results. More professionals with an understanding of scientific, management, and social issues, and the ability to communicate with scientists, managers, and the public are needed. Ecosystem management is not a rejection of an anthropocentric for a totally biocentric worldview. Rather it is management that acknowledges the importance of human needs while at the same time confronting the reality that the capacity of our world to meet those needs in perpetuity has limits and depends on the functioning of ecosystems.},

Mean shift clustering is applied to segment plant leaves in depth image. Plant leaves are extracted from the natural background by examining vegetation of the candidate segments produced by mean shift. Subsequently, individual leaves are segmented from occlusions by active contour models. Automatic initialization of the active contour models is implemented by calculating the center of divergence from the gradient vector field of depth image. The proposed segmentation scheme is tested through experiments under greenhouse conditions. The overall segmentation rate is 87.97\% while segmentation rates for single and occluded leaves are 92.10\% and 86.67\%, respectively. Approximately half of the experimental results show segmentation rates of individual leaves higher than 90\%.

We show that geometric primitives have unique signatures in this feature space, preserved even in the presence of additive noise. To extract a compact subset of points which characterizes a point cloud dataset, we perform an in-depth analysis of all point feature histograms using different distance metrics. Preliminary results show that point clouds can be roughly segmented based on the uniqueness of geometric primitives feature histograms.

All important functionalities, accessible in the software via buttons and dialogues, are described including the explanation of all necessary input parameters. The method is validated utilizing 101 point clouds of six different tree species, in the main evergreen and coniferous trees. All scanned trees have been destructively harvested to get accurate estimates of above ground biomass with which we assess the accuracy of the SimpleTree-reconstructed cylinder models. The trees were grouped into four data sets and for each one a Concordance Correlation Coefficient of at least 0.92 (0.92, 0.97, 0.92, 0.94) and an total relative error at most {\textasciitilde}8 \% (2.42\%, 3.59\%, –4.59\%, 8.27\%) was achieved in the comparison of the model results to the ground truth data. A global statistical improvement of derived cylinder radii is presented as well as an efficient optimization approach to automatically improve user given input parameters. An additional check of the SimpleTree results is presented via comparison to the results of trees reconstructed using an alternative, published method.},

In this context, the virtual surfaces are required to be smooth enough to facilitate the use of the mathematical equations that govern the motion of the droplet. Although an effective approach is to apply discrete smoothing D2-spline algorithms to reconstruct the leaf surfaces from three-dimensional scanned data, difficulties arise when dealing with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves, which tend to twist and bend. To overcome this topological difficulty, we develop a parameterisation technique that rotates and translates the original data, allowing the surface to be fitted using the discrete smoothing D2-spline methods in the new parameter space. Our algorithm uses finite element methods to represent the surface as a linear combination of compactly supported shape functions. Numerical results confirm that the parameterisation, along with the use of discrete smoothing D2-spline techniques, produces realistic virtual representations of wheat leaves.},

However, diversity in plants form and size, different surrounding environments (laboratory, greenhouse or field), and occlusions impose challenging issues. We propose the use of state-of-the-art methods for visual odometry to accurately recover camera pose and preliminary three-dimensional models on image acquisition time. Specimens of maize and sunflower were imaged using a single free-moving camera and a software tool with visual odometry capabilities. Multiple-view stereo was employed to produce dense point clouds sampling the plant surfaces. The produced three-dimensional models are accurate snapshots of the shoot state and plant measurements can be recovered in a non-invasive way. The results show a free-moving low-resolution camera is able to handle occlusions and variations in plant size and form, allowing the reconstruction of different species, and specimens in different stages of development. It is also a cheap and flexible method, suitable for different phenotyping needs. Plant traits were computed from the point clouds and compared to manually measured reference, showing millimeter accuracy. All data, including images, camera calibration, pose, and three-dimensional models are publicly available.},

In this paper, we present a computer-vision system for seedling phenotyping that combines best of both approaches by utilizing a fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method. We developed image processing methods for the identification and segmentation of plant organs (stem and leaf) from the 3D plant model. Various measurements of plant features such as plant volume, leaf area, and stem length are estimated based on these plant segments. We evaluate the accuracy of our system by comparing the measurements of our methods with ground truth measurements obtained destructively by hand.

Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can be used to derive unbiased and non-destructive estimates of tree structure and volume and can, therefore, be used to address key uncertainties in forest AGB estimates. Here we review our experience of TLS sampling strategies from 27 campaigns conducted over the past 5years, across tropical and temperate forest plots, where data was captured with a RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner. The focus is on strategies to derive Geometrical Modelling metrics (e.g. tree volume) over forest plots (≥1ha) which require the accurate co-registration of 10s to 100s of individual point clouds. We recommend a 10m × 10m sampling grid as an approach to produce a point cloud with a uniform point distribution, that can resolve higher order branches (down to a few cm in diameter) towards the top of 30+ m canopies and can be captured in a timely fashion i.e. ∼3–6days per ha. A data acquisition protocol, such as presented here, would facilitate data interoperability and inter-comparison of metrics between instruments/groups, from plot to plot and over time.},

Hence, the development of a high-resolution model that allows for the quantification of tree shading on a diurnal and annual time scale is highly demanded to generate realistic estimations of the shading dynamics in a given AFS. We describe an approach using 3D data derived from a terrestrial laser scanner and the steps undertaken to develop a vector-based model that quantifies and visualizes the shadow cast by single trees at daily, monthly, seasonal or annual levels with the input of cylinder-based tree models. It is able to compute the shadow of given tree models in time intervals of 10 min. To simulate seasonal growth and shedding of leaves, ellipsoids as replacement for leaves can be added to the tips of the tree model’s branches. The shadow model is flexible in its input of location (latitude, longitude), tree architecture and temporal resolution. Due to the possibility to feed this model with factual climate data such as cloud covers, it represents the first 3D tree model that enables the user to retrospectively analyze the shadow regime below a given tree, and to quantify shadow-related developments in AFS.},

To overcome the high degree of self-similarities and self-occlusions in plant canopy, prior knowledge of leaf shape based on features from deep siamese network are used to construct an accurate 3D model using structure from motion on wheat plants. The drought stress is characterized with a deep network based feature aggregation.

Genetic improvement requires careful measurement of plant phenotypes or plant trait characteristics, but phenotype measurement is a tedious and error-prone task for humans to perform. High-throughput phenotyping aims to eliminate the problems of manual phenotype measurement. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the efficacy of an automatic corn plant phenotyping system based on 3D holographic reconstruction. Point cloud image data were acquired from a time-of-flight 3D camera, which was integrated with a plant rotating table to form a screening station. Our method has five main steps: point cloud data filtering and merging, stem segmentation, leaf segmentation, phenotypic data extraction, and 3D holographic visualization. In an experimental study with five corn plants at their early growth stage (V3), we obtained promising results with accurate 3D holographic reconstruction. The average measurement error rate for stem major axis, stem minor axis, stem height, leaf area, leaf length and leaf angle were at 7.92\%, 15.20\%, 7.45\%, 21.89\%, 10.25\% and 11.09\%, respectively. The most challenging trait to measure was leaf area due to partial occlusions and rolling of some leaves. In future work, we plan to extend and evaluate the usability of the system in an industrial plant breeding setting.},

On the average the laser recorded 505–1070 canopy heights per stand. First, the laser mean height is computed as the arithmetic mean of the canopy heights within each stand. The laser mean height underestimates the ground truth mean height by 4.1–5.5 m. Second, a weighted mean of the laser canopy heights is computed. The individual height values are used as weights. The weighted mean height underestimates the true height by 2.1–3.6 m. Finally, the laser mean height is computed as the arithmetic mean of the largest laser values within square grid cells with cell sizes of 15–30 m. The bias of the laser estimates is in the range −0.4 m to 1.9 m. The standard deviation for differences between the laser mean heights and the ground truth mean height is 1.1–1.6 m.},

Military operations accelerated the development of airplanes. Cameras were designed especially for air use and the quality of lenses and plates was improved greatly.

	abstract = {A novel calibration process of RICOH-THETA, full-view fisheye camera, is proposed which has numerous applications as a low cost sensor in different disciplines such as photogrammetry, robotic and machine vision and so on. Ricoh Company developed this camera in 2014 that consists of two lenses and is able to capture the whole surrounding environment in one shot. In this research, each lens is calibrated separately and interior/relative orientation parameters (IOPs and ROPs) of the camera are determined on the basis of designed calibration network on the central and side images captured by the aforementioned lenses.
Accordingly, designed calibration network is considered as a free distortion grid and applied to the measured control points in the image space as correction terms by means of bilinear interpolation. By performing corresponding corrections, image coordinates are transformed to the unit sphere as an intermediate space between object space and image space in the form of spherical coordinates. Afterwards, IOPs and EOPs of each lens are determined separately through statistical bundle adjustment procedure based on collinearity condition equations.
Subsequently, ROPs of two lenses is computed from both EOPs. Our experiments show that by applying 3*3 free distortion grid, image measurements residuals diminish from 1.5 to 0.25 degrees on
aforementioned unit sphere.},

	abstract = {High spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) measurements of vegetation by remote sensing are advancing ecological research and environmental management. However, substantial economic and logistical costs limit this application, especially for observing phenological dynamics in ecosystem structure and spectral traits. Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This “Ecosynth” methodology applies photogrammetric “Structure from Motion” computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (\&lt; 130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (\&lt; USD\$4000), lightweight (\&lt; 2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30–67 points m− 2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 6.25 ha (250 m × 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2–4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4–1.2 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31–36\% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m × 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (\&lt; 1 km2) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.},

In this study, we used an indirect method, hemispheric photography, to measure and analyze the dynamics of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy openness of the three forest communities. The results show that the LAI values of DBF and LF increased gradually with plant growth and development. The highest LAI value appeared in August, while canopy openness changed inversely with LAI. The lowest value appeared in November. DBF maintained a higher LAI in August and had a more open canopy in November compared with LF. For PF, we observed little changes in the LAI and canopy openness which was attributed to the leaf retention of this evergreen species. However, a similar relation between LAI and canopy openness was found for the three forest communities: canopy openness varied inversely with LAI. The relation is exponential and significant. Therefore, canopy openness is a good indicator of LAI in forests. This result can be used to test the validity of the LAI based on remote sensing and to provide a reference for the study of the canopy heterogeneity and its effect. This also benefits modeling for fluxes of carbon, water and energy from the level of the stand to landscape.},

The camera used in this project was a traditional film camera, the canon AE-1p with a standard 50mm lens (FD 1.4). Estimates of average stand basal area per acre were made at a total of 21 sample points in 7 stands from field data and pictures taken at the sample points. Angle-count estimates made from pictures were on average about 4\% less than estimates made in the field with a prism. In its current development the use of a camera as an angle gauge is not operationally feasible in inventory applications. It does, however, have potential benefits in situations where more time is spent at points than might be spent during a cruise, such as when sampling from permanent sample points.},

In addition to the issues typically associated with processing point data, such applications raise a number of new complications, such as the complexity of the scenes scanned, along with the sheer volume of data. Consequently, automated procedures are required for processing, and analysing such data. This paper introduces a method for modelling multi-modal, geometrically complex objects in terrestrial laser scanning point data; specifically, the modelling of trees. The model method comprises a number of geometric features in conjunction with a multi-modal machine learning technique. The model can then be used for contextually dependent region growing through separating the tree into its component part at the point level. Subsequently object analysis can be performed, for example, performing volumetric analysis of a tree by removing points associated with leaves. The workflow for this process is as follows: isolate individual trees within the scanned scene, train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), separate clusters within the mixture model according to exemplar points determined by the GMM, grow the structure of the tree, and then perform volumetric analysis on the structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For this reason an image-based method for measuring the leaf characteristics of corn is presented to avoid the limitations mentioned above. With application of photogrammetric techniques, a three-dimensional corn model is reconstructed from captured images, and accurate leaf areas and leaf directions are measured on the basis of the 3D model. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed by comparing the results from the 3D model with that measured by tape in the field. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. The proposed method can save time and labour.},

The work in this study is based on the hypothesis of the existence of a linear relationship between the number of impacts of the LIDAR sensor laser beam on the vegetation and the tree leaf area. Tests performed under laboratory conditions using an ornamental tree and, subsequently, in a pear tree orchard demonstrate the correct operation of the measurement system presented in this paper. The results from both the laboratory and field tests confirm the initial hypothesis and the 3D Dynamic Measurement System is validated in field operation.

	abstract = {Plants forming a rosette during their juvenile growth phase, such as Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., are able to adjust the size, position and orientation of their leaves. These growth responses are under the control of the plants circadian clock and follow a characteristic diurnal rhythm. For instance, increased leaf elongation and hyponasty – defined here as the increase in leaf elevation angle – can be observed when plants are shaded. Shading can either be caused by a decrease in the fluence rate of photosynthetically active radiation (direct shade) or a decrease in the fluence rate of red compared with far-red radiation (neighbour detection). In this paper we report on a phenotyping approach based on laser scanning to measure the diurnal pattern of leaf hyponasty and increase in rosette size. In short days, leaves showed constitutively increased leaf elevation angles compared with long days, but the overall diurnal pattern and the magnitude of up and downward leaf movement was independent of daylength. Shade treatment led to elevated leaf angles during the first day of application, but did not affect the magnitude of up and downward leaf movement in the following day. Using our phenotyping device, individual plants can be non-invasively monitored during several days under different light conditions. Hence, it represents a proper tool to phenotype light- and circadian clock-mediated growth responses in order to better understand the underlying regulatory genetic network.},

This can be accomplished by introducing new non-destructive measuring techniques which allow quantifying growth processes of the same plants over a longer period of time (“phenotyping”). The use of a high-precision laser scanner coupled with a moveable articulated measuring arm to directly obtain 3D data non-invasively at sub-millimetre scale is investigated. This enabled reconstruction of the single barley organs leaf and stem as well as the architecture of the whole barley plant on the decimetre scale. The added data analysing process enabled multiple morphological plant parameters to be simultaneously derived from one scanning process which were highly correlated (R2 0.85–0.97) to manually obtained parameters from reference measurements. By scanning every 2–3 days organ-specific growth monitoring of single leaves (area) and single stems (height) was established for the first time for cereals. The cumulated parameters of leaf area, stem height and plant volume allowed the growth dynamics of the barley to be quantified until tillering was ended. As an example, drought effect due to reduced irrigation was shown with smallest significant differences and dated precisely. The fineness of the laser scanning measurement system indicated its appropriateness for high-precision phenotyping in plant breeding as well as for detailed morphological measuring questions in the fields of biology and agronomy.},

In recent years numerous lighting systems have been tested in greenhouses, yet their efficiency has been very difficult to measure in practice. This simulation study evaluated a number of lighting strategies using a 3D light model for natural and artificial light in combination with a 3D model of tomato. The modeling platform GroIMP was used for the simulation study. The crop was represented by 3D virtual plants of tomato with fixed architecture. Detailed data on greenhouse architecture and lamp emission patterns of different light sources were incorporated in the model. A number of illumination strategies were modeled with the calibrated model. Results were compared to the standard configuration. Moreover, adaptation of leaf angles was incorporated for testing their effect on light use efficiency. A Farquhar photosynthesis model was used to translate the absorbed light for each leaf into a produced amount of carbohydrates. The carbohydrates produced by the crop per unit emitted light from sun or HPS lamps was the highest for horizontal leaf angles or slightly downward pointing leaves, and was less for more upward leaf orientations. The simulated leaf angles did not affect light absorption from inter-lighting LED modules, but the scenario with LEDs shining slightly upward (20°) increased light absorption and light use efficiency relative to default horizontal beaming LEDs. Furthermore, the model showed that leaf orientation more perpendicular to the string of LEDs increased LED light interception.The combination of a ray tracer and a 3D crop model could compute optimal lighting of leaves by quantification of light fluxes and illustration by rendered lighting patterns. Results indicate that illumination efficiency increases when the lamp light is directed at most to leaves that have a high photosynthetic potential.},

The experiment comprised 151 genotypes of a recombinant inbred population of pepper, to examine the heritability and quantitative trait loci (QTL) of the features. Features extracted from the 3D reconstruction of the canopy were leaf size and leaf angle, with heritabilities of 0.70 and 0.56 respectively. Three QTL were found for leaf size, and one for leaf angle. From the statistical features, plant height showed a good correlation (0.93) with manual measurements, and QTL were in accordance with QTL of manual measurements.

	abstract = {3D point cloud analysis of imagery collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been shown to be a valuable tool for estimation of crop phenotypic traits, such as plant height, in several species. Spatial information about these phenotypic traits can be used to derive information about other important crop characteristics, like fresh biomass yield, which could not be derived directly from the point clouds. Previous approaches have often only considered single date measurements using a single point cloud derived metric for the respective trait. Furthermore, most of the studies focused on plant species with a homogenous canopy surface. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of UAV imagery for capturing crop height information of three vegetables (crops eggplant, tomato, and cabbage) with a complex vegetation canopy surface during a complete crop growth cycle to infer biomass. Additionally, the effect of crop development stage on the relationship between estimated crop height and field measured crop height was examined. Our study was conducted in an experimental layout at the University of Agricultural Science in Bengaluru, India. For all the crops, the crop height and the biomass was measured at five dates during one crop growth cycle between February and May 2017 (average crop height was 42.5, 35.5, and 16.0 cm for eggplant, tomato, and cabbage). Using a structure from motion approach, a 3D point cloud was created for each crop and sampling date. In total, 14 crop height metrics were extracted from the point clouds. Machine learning methods were used to create prediction models for vegetable crop height. The study demonstrates that the monitoring of crop height using an UAV during an entire growing period results in detailed and precise estimates of crop height and biomass for all three crops (R2 ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, bias ranging from \&minus;0.66 to 0.45 cm). The effect of crop development stage on the predicted crop height was found to be substantial (e.g., median deviation increased from 1\% to 20\% for eggplant) influencing the strength and consistency of the relationship between point cloud metrics and crop height estimates and, thus, should be further investigated. Altogether the results of the study demonstrate that point cloud generated from UAV-based RGB imagery can be used to effectively measure vegetable crop biomass in larger areas (relative error = 17.6\%, 19.7\%, and 15.2\% for eggplant, tomato, and cabbage, respectively) with a similar accuracy as biomass prediction models based on measured crop height (relative error = 21.6, 18.8, and 15.2 for eggplant, tomato, and cabbage).},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new robotic architecture for plant phenotyping is being introduced. The architecture consists of two robotic platforms: an autonomous ground vehicle (Vinobot) and a mobile observation tower (Vinoculer). The ground vehicle collects data from individual plants, while the observation tower oversees an entire field, identifying specific plants for further inspection by the Vinobot. The advantage of this architecture is threefold: first, it allows the system to inspect large areas of a field at any time, during the day and night, while identifying specific regions affected by biotic and/or abiotic stresses; second, it provides high-throughput plant phenotyping in the field by either comprehensive or selective acquisition of accurate and detailed data from groups or individual plants; and third, it eliminates the need for expensive and cumbersome aerial vehicles or similarly expensive and confined field platforms. As the preliminary results from our algorithms for data collection and 3D image processing, as well as the data analysis and comparison with phenotype data collected by hand demonstrate, the proposed architecture is cost effective, reliable, versatile, and extendable.},

	abstract = {Automatically correlating plant observable characteristics to their underlying genetics will streamline selection methods in plant breeding. Measurement of plant observable characteristics is called phenotyping, and knowing plant phenotypes accurately and throughout a plant's growth is central to making breeding decisions. In-field plant phenotyping in an automated and noninvasive manner is hence crucial to accelerating plant breeding methods. However, most of the existing methods on plant phenotyping using visual imaging are confined to controlled greenhouse environments. This paper presents an automated method of mapping 2D images collected in an outdoor sorghum field to segmented 3D plant units that are of interest for phenotyping. This method leverages multiple horizontal and vertical viewpoints while capturing 2D images from a robotic platform so as to generate in-field 3D reconstructions of the sorghum plant. We develop and quantitatively evaluate segmentation methods on these 3D reconstructions and also compare against reconstructions obtained from a controlled greenhouse environment. We present analysis that contrasts the role of purely local geometric features and the effect of addition of global context in both datasets. This work furthers capabilities of in-field phenotyping which paves the way forward for plant biologists to study the coupled effect of genetics and environment on improving crop yields.},

Such efforts have been significantly improved by the emergence of optical and active remote sensing techniques. This paper reviews the definitions and theories of LAI measurement with respect to direct and indirect methods. Then, the methodologies for LAI retrieval with regard to the characteristics of a range of remotely sensed datasets are discussed. Remote sensing indirect methods are subdivided into two categories of passive and active remote sensing, which are further categorized as terrestrial, aerial and satellite-born platforms. Due to a wide variety in spatial resolution of remotely sensed data and the requirements of ecological modeling, the scaling issue of LAI is discussed and special consideration is given to extrapolation of measurement to landscape and regional levels.},

Within this framework, the objective of modern phenotyping is to increase the accuracy, precision and throughput of phenotypic estimation at all levels of biological organization while reducing costs and minimizing labor through automation, remote sensing, improved data integration and experimental design. Much like the efforts to optimize genotyping during the 1980s and 1990s, designing effective phenotyping initiatives today requires multi-faceted collaborations between biologists, computer scientists, statisticians and engineers. Robust phenotyping systems are needed to characterize the full suite of genetic factors that contribute to quantitative phenotypic variation across cells, organs and tissues, developmental stages, years, environments, species and research programs. Next-generation phenotyping generates significantly more data than previously and requires novel data management, access and storage systems, increased use of ontologies to facilitate data integration, and new statistical tools for enhancing experimental design and extracting biologically meaningful signal from environmental and experimental noise. To ensure relevance, the implementation of efficient and informative phenotyping experiments also requires familiarity with diverse germplasm resources, population structures, and target populations of environments. Today, phenotyping is quickly emerging as the major operational bottleneck limiting the power of genetic analysis and genomic prediction. The challenge for the next generation of quantitative geneticists and plant breeders is not only to understand the genetic basis of complex trait variation, but also to use that knowledge to efficiently synthesize twenty-first century crop varieties.},

	abstract = {Genomic selection (GS) and high-throughput phenotyping have recently been captivating the interest of the crop breeding community from both the public and private sectors world-wide. Both approaches promise to revolutionize the prediction of complex traits, including growth, yield and adaptation to stress. Whereas high-throughput phenotyping may help to improve understanding of crop physiology, most powerful techniques for high-throughput field phenotyping are empirical rather than analytical and comparable to genomic selection. Despite the fact that the two methodological approaches represent the extremes of what is understood as the breeding process (phenotype versus genome), they both consider the targeted traits (e.g. grain yield, growth, phenology, plant adaptation to stress) as a black box instead of dissecting them as a set of secondary traits (i.e. physiological) putatively related to the target trait. Both GS and high-throughput phenotyping have in common their empirical approach enabling breeders to use genome profile or phenotype without understanding the underlying biology. This short review discusses the main aspects of both approaches and focuses on the case of genomic selection of maize flowering traits and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and plant spectral reflectance as high-throughput field phenotyping methods for complex traits such as crop growth and yield.

Field-grown plants were irrigated under well watered and water-limited conditions, with measurements taken at different times on 3 days in July and August. The system carried four sets of sensors to measure canopy height, reflectance and temperature simultaneously on four adjacent rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of 0.84 ha h–1. Measurements of canopy height, normalised difference vegetation index and temperature all showed large differences among cultivars and expected interactions of cultivars with water regime and time of day. Broad-sense heritabilities (H2)were highest for canopy height (H2 = 0.86–0.96), followed by the more environmentally sensitive normalised difference vegetation index (H2 = 0.28–0.90) and temperature (H2 = 0.01–0.90) traits. We also found a strong agreement (r2 = 0.35–0.82) between values obtained by the system, and values from aerial imagery and manual phenotyping approaches.

	abstract = {Plant diseases are responsible for major economic losses in the agricultural industry worldwide. Monitoring plant health and detecting pathogen early are essential to reduce disease spread and facilitate effective management practices. DNA-based and serological methods now provide essential tools for accurate plant disease diagnosis, in addition to the traditional visual scouting for symptoms. Although DNA-based and serological methods have revolutionized plant disease detection, they are not very reliable at asymptomatic stage, especially in case of pathogen with systemic diffusion. They need at least 1–2 days for sample harvest, processing, and analysis. Here, we describe modern methods based on nucleic acid and protein analysis. Then, we review innovative approaches currently under development. Our main findings are the following: (1) novel sensors based on the analysis of host responses, e.g., differential mobility spectrometer and lateral flow devices, deliver instantaneous results and can effectively detect early infections directly in the field; (2) biosensors based on phage display and biophotonics can also detect instantaneously infections although they can be integrated with other systems; and (3) remote sensing techniques coupled with spectroscopy-based methods allow high spatialization of results, these techniques may be very useful as a rapid preliminary identification of primary infections. We explain how these tools will help plant disease management and complement serological and DNA-based methods. While serological and PCR-based methods are the most available and effective to confirm disease diagnosis, volatile and biophotonic sensors provide instantaneous results and may be used to identify infections at asymptomatic stages. Remote sensing technologies will be extremely helpful to greatly spatialize diagnostic results. These innovative techniques represent unprecedented tools to render agriculture more sustainable and safe, avoiding expensive use of pesticides in crop protection.},

	abstract = {Early and accurate detection and diagnosis of plant diseases are key factors in plant production and the reduction of both qualitative and quantitative losses in crop yield. Optical techniques, such as RGB imaging, multi- and hyperspectral sensors, thermography, or chlorophyll fluorescence, have proven their potential in automated, objective, and reproducible detection systems for the identification and quantification of plant diseases at early time points in epidemics. Recently, 3D scanning has also been added as an optical analysis that supplies additional information on crop plant vitality. Different platforms from proximal to remote sensing are available for multiscale monitoring of single crop organs or entire fields. Accurate and reliable detection of diseases is facilitated by highly sophisticated and innovative methods of data analysis that lead to new insights derived from sensor data for complex plant-pathogen systems. Nondestructive, sensor-based methods support and expand upon visual and/or molecular approaches to plant disease assessment. The most relevant areas of application of sensor-based analyses are precision agriculture and plant phenotyping.},

	abstract = {Foliar symptoms of grapevine leaf stripe disease (GLSD, a disease within the esca complex) are linked to drastic alteration of photosynthetic function and activation of defense responses in affected grapevines several days before the appearance of the first visible symptoms on leaves. The present study suggests a methodology to investigate the relationships between high-resolution multispectral images (0.05 m/pixel) acquired using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and GLSD foliar symptoms monitored by ground surveys. This approach showed high correlation between Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) acquired by the UAV and GLSD symptoms, and discrimination between symptomatic from asymptomatic plants. High-resolution multispectral images were acquired during June and July of 2012 and 2013, in an experimental vineyard heavily affected by GLSD, located in Tuscany (Italy), where vines had been surveyed and mapped since 2003. Each vine was located with a global positioning system, and classified for appearance of foliar symptoms and disease severity at weekly intervals from the beginning of each season. Remote sensing and ground observation data were analyzed to promptly identify the early stages of disease, even before visual detection. This work suggests an innovative methodology for quantitative and qualitative analysis of spatial distribution of symptomatic plants. The system may also be used for exploring the physiological bases of GLSD, and predicting the onset of this disease.},

	abstract = {The United Nations (UN) recently released population projections based on data until 2012 and a Bayesian probabilistic methodology. Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80\% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations.
Global population growth continuing
The United Nations released new population projections for all countries in July 2014. Gerland et al. analyzed the data and describe the probabilistic population projections for the entire world as well as individual regions and countries (see the Perspective by Smeeding). World population is likely to continue growing for the rest of the century, with at least a 3.5-fold increase in the population of Africa. Furthermore, the ratio of working-age people to older people is almost certain to decline substantially in all countries, not just currently developed ones.

	abstract = {Ground cover is an important physiological trait affecting crop radiation capture, water-use efficiency and grain yield. It is challenging to efficiently measure ground cover with reasonable precision for large numbers of plots, especially in tall crop species. Here we combined two image-based methods to estimate plot-level ground cover for three species, from either an ortho-mosaic or undistorted (i.e. corrected for lens and camera effects) images captured by cameras using a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Reconstructed point clouds and ortho-mosaics for the whole field were created and a customised image processing workflow was developed to (1) segment the ‘whole-field’ datasets into individual plots, and (2) ‘reverse-calculate’ each plot from each undistorted image. Ground cover for individual plots was calculated by an efficient vegetation segmentation algorithm. For 79\% of plots, estimated ground cover was greater from the ortho-mosaic than from images, particularly when plants were small, or when older/taller in large plots. While there was a good agreement between the ground cover estimates from ortho-mosaic and images when the target plot was positioned at a near-nadir view near the centre of image (cotton: R2 = 0.97, sorghum: R2 = 0.98, sugarcane: R2 = 0.84), ortho-mosaic estimates were 5\% greater than estimates from these near-nadir images. Because each plot appeared in multiple images, there were multiple estimates of the ground cover, some of which should be excluded, e.g. when the plot is near edge within an image. Considering only the images with near-nadir view, the reverse calculation provides a more precise estimate of ground cover compared with the ortho-mosaic. The methodology is suitable for high throughput phenotyping for applications in agronomy, physiology and breeding for different crop species and can be extended to provide pixel-level data from other types of cameras including thermal and multi-spectral models.},

	abstract = {The relationship between morphological characteristics (e.g. gravel size, coverage, angularity and orientation) and local geomorphic features (e.g. slope gradient and aspect) of desert has been used to explore the evolution process of Gobi desert. Conventional quantification methods are time-consuming, inefficient and even prove impossible to determine the characteristics of large numbers of gravels. We propose a rapid image-based method to obtain the morphological characteristics of gravels on the Gobi desert surface, which is called the “morphological characteristics gained effectively technique” (McGET). The image of the Gobi desert surface was classified into gravel clusters and background by a machine-learning “classification and regression tree” (CART) algorithm. Then gravel clusters were segmented into individual gravel clasts by separating objects in images using a “watershed segmentation” algorithm. Thirdly, gravel coverage, diameter, aspect ratio and orientation were calculated based on the basic principles of 2D computer graphics. We validated this method with two independent datasets in which the gravel morphological characteristics were obtained from 2728 gravels measured in the field and 7422 gravels measured by manual digitization. Finally, we applied McGET to derive the spatial variation of gravel morphology on the Gobi desert along an alluvial-proluvial fan located in Hami, Xinjiang, China. The validated results show that the mean gravel diameter measured in the field agreed well with that calculated by McGET for large gravels (R2=0.89, P{\textless}0.001). Compared to manual digitization, the McGET accuracies for gravel coverage, gravel diameter and aspect ratio were 97\%, 83\% and 96\%, respectively. The orientation distributions calculated were consistent across two different methods. More importantly, McGET significantly shortens the time cost in obtaining gravel morphological characteristics in the field and laboratory. The spatial variation results show that the gravel coverage ranged from 88\% to 65\%, the gravel diameter was unimodally distributed and ranged from 19mm to 13mm. Most gravels were bladed or rod-like, with a mean aspect ratio of 1.57, and had no preferred orientation on the surveyed Gobi desert. From the center to the edge of the fan, gravel coverage decreased 2.2\% per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.69, P{\textless}0.001), mean gravel diameter decreased 0.5mm per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.52, P{\textless}0.001), and mean aspect ratio slightly increased 0.004 per 100m elevation decrease (R2=0.26, P{\textless}0.05). These results imply that surface washing was the main process on the investigated Gobi desert. This study demonstrates that the new method can quickly and accurately calculate the gravel coverage, diameter, aspect ratio and orientation from the images of Gobi desert.},

              Sorghum bicolor
              L. Moench) depends on the distribution of crop-heads in varying branching arrangements. Therefore, counting the head number per unit area is critical for plant breeders to correlate with the genotypic variation in a specific breeding field. However, measuring such phenotypic traits manually is an extremely labor-intensive process and suffers from low efficiency and human errors. Moreover, the process is almost infeasible for large-scale breeding plantations or experiments. Machine learning-based approaches like deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detectors are promising tools for efficient object detection and counting. However, a significant limitation of such deep learning-based approaches is that they typically require a massive amount of hand-labeled images for training, which is still a tedious process. Here, we propose an active learning inspired weakly supervised deep learning framework for sorghum head detection and counting from UAV-based images. We demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce human labeling effort without compromising final model performance (

The unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based photogrammetry is combined with terrestrial photogrammetry executed by walking inside the stand and the individual tree parameters are estimated. We compare two automatic methods for processing of the point clouds and the delineation of stem circumference at breast height. The error of the diameter estimation was observed to be under 1 cm root mean square error (RMSE) and the height estimation error was 1 m. Apart from the mentioned accuracy, the main advantage of the proposed work is shorter time demand for field measurement; we could complete both inventories of 1 hectare forest stand in less than 2 h of field work.},

The ranges of diameter at breast height (DBH) and height to a 10 cm upper-stem diameter were 16–66 cm and 12–20 m, respectively. Camera stations located 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 m from the stem were studied to determine the best distance to be used with the maximum wide angle setting on the camera. Geometric mean diameter estimates from the 12 and 15 m distances were within ±4 cm at any height (95\% χ2). Though unbiased, measurement variation was found to increase with stem height. Using camera derived heights and diameters, volumes were found to be within 8\% of volumes calculated using taped measurements of individual stems two times out of three — an improvement over existing DBH-height volume equations. This preliminary work demonstrates the ability of using a digital camera to acquire stem diameters and heights. Some limitations of the current technology are also noted. By combining equipment and procedural modifications with improved data flow from imagery to information, terrestrial digital imagery may revolutionize stem or even plot level data collection.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a segmentation method that isolates individual tree crowns using airborne LiDAR data. The proposed approach captures the topological structure of the forest in hierarchical data structures, quantifies topological relationships of tree crown components in a weighted graph, and finally partitions the graph to separate individual tree crowns. This novel bottom-up segmentation strategy is based on several quantifiable cohesion criteria that act as a measure of belief on weather two crown components belong to the same tree. An added flexibility is provided by a set of weights that balance the contribution of each criterion, thus effectively allowing the algorithm to adjust to different forest structures. The LiDAR data used for testing was acquired in Louisiana, inside the Clear Creek Wildlife management area with a RIEGL LMS-Q680i airborne laser scanner. Three 1ha forest areas of different conditions and increasing complexity were segmented and assessed in terms of an accuracy index (AI) accounting for both omission and commission. The three areas were segmented under optimum parameterization with an AI of 98.98\%, 92.25\% and 74.75\% respectively, revealing the excellent potential of the algorithm. When segmentation parameters are optimized locally using plot references the AI drops to 98.23\%, 89.24\%, and 68.04\% on average with plot sizes of 1000m2 and 97.68\%, 87.78\% and 61.1\% on average with plot sizes of 500m2. More than introducing a segmentation algorithm, this paper proposes a powerful framework featuring flexibility to support a series of segmentation methods including some of those recurring in the tree segmentation literature. The segmentation method may extend its applications to any data of topological nature or data that has a topological equivalent.},

Data collection is expensive, but costs are reduced when multiple products are derived from each mission. We examined how well low-density leaf-off LiDAR, originally flown for terrain mapping, quantified hardwood forest structure. We measured tree density, dbh, basal area, mean tree height, Lorey's mean tree height, and sawtimber and pulpwood volume at 114 field plots. Using univariate and multivariate linear regression models, we related field data to LiDAR return heights. We compared models using all LiDAR returns and only first returns. First-return univariate models explained more variability than all-return models; however, the differences were small for multivariate models. Multiple regression models had R2 values of 65\% for sawtimber and pulpwood volume, 63\% for Lorey's mean tree height, 55\% for mean tree height, 48\% for mean dbh, 46\% for basal area, and 13\% for tree density. However, the standard error of the mean for predictions ranged between 1 and 4\%, and this level of error is well within levels needed for broad-scale forest assessments. Our results suggest that low-density LiDAR intended for terrain mapping is valuable for broad-scale hardwood forest inventories.},

	abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (C ab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

As demands on the world’s forests have grown, scientists and professionals are increasingly called on to quantify forest composition, structure, and the goods and services forests provide.  Grounded in geometry, sampling theory, and ecology as well as practical field experience, forest mensuration offers opportunities for creative problem solving and critical thinking. 

This fifth edition of the classic volume, Forest Mensuration, includes coverage of traditional and emerging topics, with attention to SI and Imperial units throughout. The book has been reorganised from the fourth edition to better integrate non-timber and ecological aspects of forest mensuration at the tree, stand, forest, and landscape scales throughout.  The new edition includes new chapters that specifically address the integration of remotely sensed data in the forest inventory process, and inventory methods for dead and downed wood. One unifying theme, not only for traditional forestry but for the non-timber inventory and for remote sensing, is the use of covariates to make sampling more efficient and spatially explicit.  This is introduced in the introductory chapter on statistics and the chapter on sampling designs has been restructured to highlight this approach and lay the foundation for further learning. New examples will be developed throughout the textbook with an emphasis on current issues and international practice.

Students in applied forestry programs will find ample coverage of forest products and timber inventory, while expanded material on biodiversity, biomass and carbon inventory, downed dead wood, and the growing role of remote sensing in forest assessment will be valuable to a broader audience in applied ecology.},

This device, along with clinometer angle measurements and distance, can be used to rapidly capture data of an entire tree stem. Subsequent analysis can generate bole heights, diameters, and form measurements. We have found the diameter measurements taken from digital images to be nearly equal to caliper measurements on felled trees.

They have opened a wide range of application fields within a short period of time. Beyond interactive measurement in 3D point clouds, techniques for the automatic detection of objects and the determination of geometric parameters form a high priority research issue. With the quality of 3D point clouds generated by laser scanners and the automation potential in data processing, terrestrial laser scanning is also becoming a useful tool for forest inventory. This paper presents a brief review of current laser scanner systems from a technological point of view and discusses different scanner technologies and system parameters regarding their suitability for forestry applications. Methods for the automatic detection of trees in terrestrial laser scanner data as well as the automatic determination of diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height and 3D stem profiles are outlined. Reliability and precision of the techniques are analysed on the basis of several pilot studies. In these pilot studies more than 97\% of the trees could be detected correctly, and DBH could be determined with a precision of about 1.8 cm.},

Such algorithms typically require accurate detection of trees, and estimation of tree center locations in laser data. Both these operations depend on accurate estimations of tree trunk diameter. Diameter estimations are important also for several other forestry automation and remote sensing applications. This paper evaluates several existing algorithms for diameter estimation using 2D laser scanner data. Enhanced algorithms, compensating for beam width and using multiple scans, were also developed and evaluated. The best existing algorithms overestimated tree trunk diameter by ca. 40\%.

With a view to its integration in photogrammetric tools, the shape of the epipolar line is studied both in 3D space and as a 2D mapping; the results obtained with simulation data are analysed.},

	abstract = {We develop a new technique to measure the exact upper diameters of trees that is comparatively simple and inexpensive. We can measure the diameters of entire tree trunks efficiently and with high precision. The system uses a digital camera with a {\textasciitilde}15 - 30× telephoto lens to take a photograph that can be used for measuring the diameter of the upper part of a comparatively slender tree trunk. Since this method requires a measuring distance and the height of the target point in the image, a range finder capable of measuring angles was combined with the main digiscoping system. A range finder sensor uses a laser and makes a 360 degree angle of observation possible. The diameter of a target position of the objective tree can be obtained by measuring the digital image using image editing software and calculations from spreadsheet software. We focus on the Japanese cedar species in the southwestern part of Japan. Photographic measurements were obtained prior to thinning. The estimates that we obtained largely agree with the true measurements of all trees. With regard to the estimated accuracy of all measured trees, the maximum error ratio was 7.0\% (1.45 cm), with a {\textasciitilde}2\% - 4\% error for most of the estimated results. Although the absolute value of the estimation error was 1.87 cm (5.3\%) at the maximum (9.87 m in height and 35.5 cm in diameter), an estimation accuracy of},

However, the vertical geometry of tree stems hampers a direct measurement by means of orthographic aerial imagery. Nevertheless, the DBH in deciduous forest stands could be measured from UAV-based imagery using the width of a stem´s cast shadow projected on the ground. Here, we compare in-situ measured DBH of 100 trees with the DBH visually interpreted from cast-shadows derived in UAV-based aerial imagery. Then, based on simulated datasets, we determine suitable DBH sampling sizes for a robust and efficient retrieval of stand diameter distributions. The UAV-based DBH estimation resulted in an r$^{\textrm{2}}$ of 0.74, RMSE of 7.61\&thinsp;cm, NRMSE of 12.8\&thinsp;\% and approximately unbiased results. According to our simulations it can be assumed that a sample size of 25\&ndash;50 individual DBH measurements per forest stand allows estimating reliable diameter distributions. The presented pilot study gives a first insight on the potential of such an approach for operational assessments of diameter distribution in deciduous forest stands and might be particularly interesting for stands in difficult terrain situations. The presented approach can be extended to estimate the basal area, timber stock or biomass.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Individual tree segmentations, usually derived from the canopy height model, are used to derive individual tree structural attributes such as tree height, crown diameter, canopy based height, and others. In this study we develop a new algorithm to segment individual trees from the small footprint discrete return airborne lidar point cloud. The new algorithm adopts a top-to-bottom region growing approach that segments trees individually and sequentially from the tallest to the shortest. We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed coniferous forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, USA. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86\% of the trees (“recall”), 94\% of the segmented trees were correct (“precision”), and the overall F-score is 0.9. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good potential in segmenting individual trees in mixed conifer stands of similar structure using small footprint, discrete return lidar data.},

	abstract = {Forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks and fluxes is important in the context of anthropogenic global change. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field- and ALS-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 = 0·98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like REDD++.},

This paper summarizes the findings beyond the final report after analyzing the results obtained in different tree height classes. Omission/Commission statistics as well as neighborhood relations are taken into account. Additionally, four automatic tree detection and extraction techniques were added to the test. Several methods in this experiment were superior to manual processing in the dominant, co-dominant and suppressed tree storeys. In general, as expected, the taller the tree, the better the location accuracy. The accuracy of tree height, after removing gross errors, was better than 0.5 m in all tree height classes with the best methods investigated in this experiment. For forest inventory, minimum curvature-based tree detection accompanied by point cloud-based cluster detection for suppressed trees is a solution that deserves attention in the future.},

The method is applicable to a variety of different sized trees in situations where the trunks are clearly visible. Results for taper measurement and wood volume calculation are presented for Eucalyptus regnans F. von Muell., Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindley) Buchholz and Quercus robur L. Branch allometrics are provided for E. regnans. The largest errors arose from fi eld observations. If the trees are asymmetrical in cross-section (e.g. due to irregular buttressing or forked stems), or if there is no vantage point perpendicular to the direction of lean, then photographs from more than one side are recommended. Accuracy and precision of geometric reproduction by the image rectification process, and the volume calculation, were tested using mathematically generated tree components. The errors in the branch volumes of the virtual tree showed complex trends due to interacting factors. Volumes were underestimated by an average 0.5\% for stems and 4\% for branches. Due to the area defi cit resulting from non-circular cross-sections of the buttress, overestimation of stem volumes could be as high as 10\% on average for mature trees. However, the area defi cit was known for E. regnans and incorporated into the volume calculation. The underestimation of volumes would help counteract overestimation due to the area deficit. The application of this method to carbon accounting in forests and woodlands is explained.},

Cover images instead are obtained by pointing a 70mm equivalent focal length lens (in 35mm format) straight upwards. Measurements of cover and indirect estimates of plant area index (Lt) were made in 12 stands of 6–8 years old Eucalyptus globulus. L was measured using destructive sampling and allometry in nine of these stands and ranged from 2.5 to 6.6. Both foliage cover and Lt from the PCA were well correlated with L from allometry, but fullframe fisheye photography provided poor estimates of L despite corrections for foliage clumping. Sampling location had a significant effect on estimates of crown porosity, crown cover and zenithal clumping index from cover photography. The zenithal extinction coefficient (k), calculated from L, crown porosity and cover, ranged from 0.14 to 0.25 and appeared to decrease as L increased; hence, we were unable to obtain an unambiguous estimate of k for E. globulus stands. Nonetheless, the study showed that L can be estimated from foliage cover with similar certainty to that of the PCA. We conclude that the greatest challenge facing indirect estimation of L in forests using photographic methods is to separate the effects of foliage angle from those of foliage clumping.},

Cover images are obtained by pointing a 70mm equivalent focal length lens (in 35mm format) straight upwards.

L, from destructive sampling, averaged between 2 and 2.4 for stands planted at between 1250 and 10,000 trees ha−1 but was only 1.3 for the stands planted at 625treesha−1. Cover photography provided good indirect estimates of L assuming a spherical leaf distribution, except in the stands with 10,000treesha−1. These trees appeared to have a more horizontal leaf angle based on the calculated zenithal extinction coefficient for those stands (∼0.7). Rapid and automated analysis of cover images using WinSCANOPY 2006 yielded similar results to manual image analysis using Adobe Photoshop. Estimates of L from fullframe fisheye photography were better correlated with L from destructive sampling than L estimated from circular fisheye photography, but neither performed as well as cover photography. Photographic methods that use a single threshold to separate sky and foliage appear less sensitive to the camera's gamma function than methods that use a two-value threshold. Higher resolution ({\textgreater}8 megapixel) cameras and better lenses, may further improve L estimation using fullframe fisheye photography. We recommend that cover photography be used for routine L estimation in broadleaf forest until it is demonstrated that fisheye methods can provide similar accuracy.},

	abstract = {A great drawback of photographic methods for estimating canopy metrics such as leaf area index (L) and cover has been the tedious and time consuming image processing step and the perceived sensitivity of the results to image processing. This paper describes an automatic method, the ‘two-corner method’, for detecting homogeneous regions of canopy and sky, and for quantifying the number of mixed pixels in canopy images. Mixed pixels are pixels of intermediate brightness value that do not very obviously belong to either sky or canopy. Four image classification methods were tested for classifying mixed pixels as canopy or sky. When applied to both fisheye and cover images of Eucalyptus forest, none of the more complicated classification methods yielded results that greatly differed from a simple global binary threshold classification, even if those metrics were derived from the zenithal distribution of gap fraction or gap size. Increasing photographic exposure by one stop reduced calculated L by 9–12\%, but modern digital camera technology makes it much easier to correctly expose fisheye canopy images, either by examining the image histogram in the field or by taking multiple exposures and choosing the best exposures after automatic processing. This study is the first to systematically quantify the number of mixed pixels in canopy images and demonstrated that fisheye images contain more mixed pixels than cover images, and that the number of mixed pixels increases with increasing vegetation cover. In conclusion, the recent advances in digital camera technology, combined with robust and automated image analysis methods, are rapidly bringing the field of photographic analysis of canopy structure to maturity, where the field techniques and image processing aspects of the methodology are no longer significant factors limiting its application by non-experts. In the case of fisheye photography, research is still needed to improve the estimation of L in clumped canopies.},

	abstract = {Accurate and precise location of trees from data acquired under-the-canopy is challenging and time-consuming. However, current forestry practices would benefit tremendously from the knowledge of tree coordinates, particularly when the information used to position them is acquired with inexpensive sensors. Therefore, the objective of our study is to geo-reference trees using point clouds created from the images acquired below canopy. We developed a procedure that uses the coordinates of the trees seen from above canopy to position the same trees seen below canopy. To geo-reference the trees from above canopy we captured images with an unmanned aerial vehicle. We reconstructed the trunk with photogrammetric point clouds built with a structure\&ndash;from\&ndash;motion procedure from images recorded in a circular pattern at multiple locations throughout the stand. We matched the trees segmented from below canopy with the trees extracted from above canopy using a non-rigid point-matching algorithm. To ensure accuracy, we reduced the number of matching trees by dividing the trees segmented from above using a grid with 50 m cells. Our procedure was implemented on a 7.1 ha Douglas-fir stand from Oregon USA. The proposed procedure is relatively fast, as approximately 600 trees were mapped in approximately 1 min. The procedure is sensitive to the point density, directly impacting tree location, as differences larger than 2 m between the coordinates of the tree top and the bottom part of the stem could lead to matching errors larger than 1 m. Furthermore, the larger the number of trees to be matched the higher the accuracy is, which could allow for misalignment errors larger than 2 m between the locations of the trees segmented from above and below.},

This paper demonstrates the utility of the technology for characterizing trees in complex habitats such as boreal mixedwood forests. ContextAccurate knowledge of tree stem taper and volume are key components of forest inventories to manage and study forest resources. Recent developments have seen the increasing use of ground-based point clouds, including from digital terrestrial photogrammetry (DTP), to provide accurate estimates of these key forest attributes.AimsIn this study, we evaluated the utility of DTP based on a small set of photos (12 per tree) for estimating stem volume and taper on a set of 15 trees from 6 different species (Populus tremuloides, Picea glauca, Pinus contorta latifolia, Betula papyrifera, Picea mariana, Abies balsamea) in a boreal mixedwood forest in Alberta, Canada.MethodsWe constructed accurate photogrammetric point clouds and derived taper and volume from three point cloud–based methods, which were then compared with estimates from conventional, field-based measurements. All methods were evaluated for their accuracy based on field-measured taper and volume of felled trees.ResultsOf the methods tested, we found that the point cloud–derived diameters in a taper curve matching approach performed the best at estimating diameters at the lowest parts of the stem ({\textless} 30\% of total tree height), while using known DBH and height provided more accurate estimates for the upper parts of the stem ({\textgreater} 50\% of total height). Using the field-measured DBH and height as inputs to calculate stem volume yielded the most accurate predictions; however, these were not significantly different from the best point cloud-based estimates.ConclusionThe methodology confirmed that using a small set of photographs provided accurate estimates of individual tree DBH, taper, and volume across a range of species and size gradients (10.8–40.4 cm DBH).},

Twenty shortwave pyranometers were deployed in forest plots of varying canopy structures and densities in sparse birch forest near Abisko, Sweden, in spring 2011 and mixed conifer forest near Sodankylä, Finland, in spring 2012. Above-canopy global and diffuse shortwave irradiances were also measured. These data were used to test a model that uses hemispherical photographs to explicitly estimate both diffuse radiation and direct beam transmission, as well as two models that apply bulk canopy parameters and versions of Beers Law. All three models predict canopy shortwave transmission similarly well for leafless birch forest, but for conifers, the bulk methods perform poorly. In addition, an existing model of multiple reflections between canopy and snow was found to be suitable for birch, but not conifers. A new bulk approach based on empirical relationships with hemisphere-averaged sky view fraction showed improved performance for both sites; this suggests benefits of avoiding the use of plant area index calculated from optical methods, which can introduce errors. Furthermore, tests using common empirical diffuse radiation models were shown to underestimate shortwave transmission by up to 7\% relative to using the data, suggesting that new diffuse models are required for high latitudes.

Snow ablation rates, in mm SWE day−1, specific to each depth sensor location were estimated as the seasonal maximum SWE divided by the number of days from peak SWE to snow disappearance. Estimates of sub-canopy direct beam solar irradiance and sky view factor (SVFθ) derived from hemispherical photographs were used to explain the spatial distribution of snow ablation rates. Cumulative direct beam irradiance during the observed snowmelt periods explained the most variability in snow ablation rates for the most cloud-free melt season (58\% in 2008; 4 cloudy days; at 15 sensor locations snowmelt duration ranged from 39 days to 88 days and direct irradiance ranged from 96MJm−2 to 603MJm−2) and explained the least ablation variability for the cloudiest melt season of the study (29\% in 2009; 23 cloudy days; at 12 sensor locations snowmelt duration ranged from 45 days to 79 days and direct irradiance ranged from 121MJm−2 to 410MJm−2). Conversely, sky view factor (SVFθ) explained the most variability in snow ablation rates under cloudier conditions (i.e. 87\% in 2009) and the relationships were strongest when developed over the entire hemisphere (i.e. SVF90°, which ranged from 0.17 to 0.31). Combined, the two metrics studied here (sub-canopy direct beam irradiance and SVFθ) may be used to explain much of the observed plot-scale variability in SWE ablation at finer time scales relevant to snow and hydrological model applications.},

We evaluated the expectations that: (i) size distribution of populations of Araucaria angustifolia, a large conifer that dominates southern Brazil's mixed forests, is left-skewed in old-growth forests but right-skewed in logged forests, indicating chronic recruitment failure in the first kind of habitat as well as a recruitment pulse in the second; (ii) seedlings and juveniles are found under more open-canopy microsites than would be expected by chance; and (iii) reproductive females would be aggregated at the coarse spatial scales in which past massive recruitment events are expected to have occurred, and young plants would be spatially associated with females due to the prevalence of vertebrate and large-bird seed dispersers. Data were collected in the threatened mixed conifer–hardwood forests in southern Brazil in ten 1-ha plots and one 0.25-ha plot that was hit by a small tornado in 2003. Five of these plots corresponded to unlogged old-growth forests, three to forests where A. angustifolia was selectively logged ca. 60years ago and two to forests selectively logged ca. 20years ago. For the first time, ontogenetic life stages of this important conifer are identified and described. The first and second expectations were fulfilled, and the third was partially fulfilled, since seedlings and juveniles were hardly ever associated with reproductive females. These results confirm the generalization of the current conceptual model of emergent long-lived pioneer regeneration to Araucaria angustifolia and associate its regeneration niche to the occupation of large-scale disturbances with long return times.},

	abstract = {Energy budget dynamics under forest canopies are strongly influenced by the large spatial variability of radiative and turbulent transfers in this environment. Incoming solar radiation under canopies has a particularly high degree of spatial variability. Transmission of solar radiation through a forest canopy varies with the size and location of the canopy gaps, as well as canopy leaf area. Modeling this transmission has proven challenging owing to the highly variable nature of the gaps within and between tree crowns, particularly in discontinuous canopies. This study describes and simulates the solar variability incident on the snow surface beneath two conifer forests. Objectives of this work are (1) to evaluate the variability of incoming solar radiation data with respect to canopy structure and cloudiness, (2) to correlate measured solar radiation transmission with predicted solar transmission based on analysis of hemispherical photographs, and (3) to examine the impact of measured and predicted transmission factors on the seasonal net radiative exchanges and snow ablation, based on snow process modeling. Observations were made during the winters of 2002 and 2003 in two predominately lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, one discontinuous and one relatively uniform, at the Local Scale Observation Site (LSOS) in Fraser, CO, USA, as part of the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX). The canopy structure of all trees in the 0.8ha triangular plot was measured and mapped in detail. We measured incoming global solar radiation at the snow surface beneath the discontinuous and the uniform canopies using arrays of 10 upward looking pyranometers at each site. Incoming global solar radiation was also measured above the canopy. Hemispherical photographs were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 995 with a fisheye converter at each radiometer location in both canopies, and were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer (GLA) software. We found good agreement between measured and GLA-predicted transmissivities (r2 = 0.86) when all data from both years were considered. Transmission factors derived from hemispheric photos and GLA software can be used to specify the distribution of solar flux under a canopy, instead of direct solar flux measurements, without degradation in snow model melt predictions.},

	abstract = {The change of fraction vegetation cover (FVC) is the key ecological index for vegetation dynamics of dryland ecosystem. However, it is difficult to directly map woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation in the dryland from the satellite images due to the mixture of their distribution at small scale. Emerging UAV remote sensing provides a good opportunity to capture and quantify the distribution of the sparse vegetation in the drylands ecosystem. In this study, we proposed a new method to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC based on the high-resolution orthomosaic generated from UAV images by the machine learning algorithm of classification and regression tree (CART). This proposed method was validated and evaluated by visual interpretation, the detailed ground measurement dataset of 4832 trees and 18,798 shrubs and three popular machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT). The overall assessments showed good overall accuracy (0.78), average accuracy (0.76), and the Kappa coefficient (0.64). The FVC of woody vegetation calculated from orthomosaic agreed well with that estimated from ground measurements. Both group of FVC have a stable linear relationship over different spatial scales. The proposed method showed higher efficiency of 166\%, 111\% and 290\% than SVM, RF, GBDT respectively. A new optimized model was developed to reduce the workload of vegetation investigation and to design more efficient sampling strategies. The proposed method was incorporated into an interactive web-based software “UAV- High Resolution imagery Analysis Platform” (UAV-HiRAP, http://www.uav-hirap.org). Our study demonstrates that UAV-HiRAP combined with UAV platform can be a powerful tool to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC for sparse vegetation in the drylands. The new optimization model will inspire researchers to design more effective sampling strategies for future field investigation.},

We present the general overview of the programs, the solar radiation regime, and the canopy structure estimates as processed by CIMES software. The most important point of CIMES compared to other software would be to have statistics and estimates for each single photosite including all available theoretical and empirical algorithms, so that anyone working on methods rather than application will have more freedom compared to other software.

The matrix output data of camera sensors (i.e., raw data) can be used to avoid gamma correction. Nevertheless, the impact of an interpreter or a thresholding algorithm is still present. In this paper, we present a new methodology which applies a previously published linear conversion method of raw data to a single below-canopy image to obtain unbiased estimates of canopy gap fraction. The new methodology derives an above-canopy reference image from a below-canopy image using sky radiance information available in gaps. A sky radiance model and interpolation are used to create the above-canopy image which could alternatively be obtained with a second sensor. To evaluate the new method, we conducted test measurements in three mature forest stands. The comparison of image processing output to LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer data showed high agreement and repeatability. The proposed method can be applied in versatile future versions of hemispherical image analysis programs to create unbiased comparison data for other manual or automatic image processing methods designed for plant canopies.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has evolved significantly in different applications as it provides a special platform capable of combining the benefits of terrestrial and aerial remote sensing. Therefore, such technology has been established as an important source of data collection for different precision agriculture (PA) applications such as crop health monitoring and weed management. Generally, these PA applications depend on performing a vegetation segmentation process as an initial step, which aims to detect the vegetation objects in collected agriculture fields’ images. The main result of the vegetation segmentation process is a binary image, where vegetations are presented in white color and the remaining objects are presented in black. Such process could easily be performed using different vegetation indexes derived from multispectral imagery. Recently, to expand the use of UAV imagery systems for PA applications, it was important to reduce the cost of such systems through using low-cost RGB cameras Thus, developing vegetation segmentation techniques for RGB images is a challenging problem. The proposed paper introduces a new vegetation segmentation methodology for low-cost UAV RGB images, which depends on using Hue color channel. The proposed methodology follows the assumption that the colors in any agriculture field image can be distributed into vegetation and non-vegetations colors. Therefore, four main steps are developed to detect five different threshold values using the hue histogram of the RGB image, these thresholds are capable to discriminate the dominant color, either vegetation or non-vegetation, within the agriculture field image. The achieved results for implementing the proposed methodology showed its ability to generate accurate and stable vegetation segmentation performance with mean accuracy equal to 87.29\% and standard deviation as 12.5\%.},

	abstract = {Canopy closure (CC) is an important parameter in many fields. It can be obtained from digital hemispherical photographs (DHPs) by converting the pixels to black or white according to their nature: canopy or not. DHP exposure is a key factor that controls accuracy in CC determination. Many accurate pre- and post-treatments exist for enhancing the exposure, but these methods often require specific knowledge. To be more “user-friendly” compared to the raw equations provided in the literature, we have proposed a new software, DHPT 1.0, that calculates CC from DHPs using hue-enhancing methods before an automatic thresholding calculation. DHPT 1.0 does not require manual settings, thus avoiding errors caused by operator misjudgement. The first step of this study was to calibrate the enhancement methods to make DHPT 1.0 able to accurately calculate CC regardless of the photograph exposure. We have therefore used 210 digital photographs that regroup seven locations along a visual gradient of CC and of exposures. After calibration, the accuracy of DHPT 1.0 was compared with the accuracy of three software packages that are widely used by experts: Canopon2, GLA 2.0, and WINPHOT 5.0. A batch of two sets of 10 DHPs divided into one set of over-exposed DHPs and one set of under-exposed DHPs from 10 locations along a gradient of CC was used for the comparison. DHPT 1.0 provides the most accurate results, with an average error of 8\% between the same under-saturated or over-saturated DHP.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2},
	abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300{\textbackslash}times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500{\textbackslash}times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

Using this method enables the photographer to accurately capture scenes that contain a high dynamic range, i.e., scenes that have both very bright and very dark regions. The approach requires an initial calibration, where the camera response function is determined. Once the response function for a camera is known, high dynamic range images can be computed easily. The high dynamic range output image consists of a weighted average of the multiply-exposed input images, and thus contains information captured by each of the input images. From a computational standpoint, the proposed algorithm is very efficient, and requires little processing time to determine a solution.},

The commonly used methods for greenness identification are based on visible spectral-index, such as the excess green index, the excess green minus excess red index, the vegetative index, the color index of vegetation extraction, the combined index. All these visible spectral-index based methods are working on the assumption that plants display a clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only background element. In fact, the brightness and contrast of an image coming from outdoor environments are seriously affected by the weather conditions and the capture time. The color of the plant varies from dark green to bright green. The back ground elements may contain crop straw, straw ash besides soil. These environmental factors always make the visible spectral-index based methods unable to work correctly. In this paper, an HSV decision tree based method for greenness identification from maize seedling images captured outdoors is proposed. Firstly, the image was converted from RGB color space to HSV color space to avoid influence of illumination. Secondly, most of the background pixels were removed according to their hue values compared with the ones of green plants. Thirdly, the pixels of wheat straws whose hue values were intersected with tender green leaves were eliminated subject to their hues, saturations and values. At last, thresholding was employed to get the green plants. The results indicate that the proposed method can recognize greenness pixels correctly from the crop images captured outdoors.},

            Canopy gap fraction has been estimated from hemispherical images using a thresholding method to separate sky and canopy pixels. The optimal objective thresholding rule has been searched by many authors without satisfactory results due to long list of reasons. Some recent studies have shown that unprocessed readings of camera CCD or CMOS sensor (raw data) have linear relationship with incident radiation. This allows a pair of cameras used in similar to a pair of plant canopy analyzers and canopy gap fraction can be calculated as the ratio of below canopy image and above canopy image. We tested new freeware program HemiSpherical Project Manager (HSP) for the restoration of the above canopy image from below canopy image which allows making field measurements with single below canopy operated camera. Results of perforated panel image analysis and comparison of plant area index (PAI) estimated independently by three operators from real canopy hemispherical images showed high degree of reliability of the new approach. Determination coefficients of linear regression of the PAI estimations of the three operators were 0.9962, 0.9875 and 0.9825. The canopy gap fraction data obtained from HSP were used to validate Nobis-Hunziker automatic thresholding algorithm. The results indicated that the Nobis-Hunziker algorithm underestimated PAI from out of camera JPEG images and overestimated PAI from raw data.},

	abstract = {Abstract: At least 10 different methods to determine exposure for hemispherical photographs were used by scientists in the last two decades, severely hampering comparability among studies. Here, an overview of the applied methods is reported. For the standardization of photographic exposure, a time-consuming reference measurement in the open land towards the unobstructed sky was required so far. The two Histogram Methods proposed here make use of the technical advances of digital cameras which enable users to assess a photograph’s histogram directly at the location of measurement. This avoids errors occurring due to variations in sky lighting happening in the time span between taking the reference measurement and reaching the sample location within the forest. The Histogram Methods speed up and simplify taking hemispherical photographs, and introduce an objectively applicable, standardized approach. We highlight the importance of correct exposure by quantifying the overestimation of gap fraction resulting from auto-exposed photographs under a wide range of canopy openness situations. In our study, gap fraction derived from auto-exposed photographs reached values up to 900\% higher than those derived from non-overexposed photographs. By investigating the size of the largest gap per photograph and the number of small gaps (gaps contributing less than 0.1\% to gap fraction), we concluded that the overestimation of gap fraction resulted mainly from the overexposure of vegetation surrounding large gaps.},

	abstract = {Digital hemispherical photography (DHP) has become a widely used tool for the estimation of forest structural attributes, such as gap fraction, Leaf Area Index (LAI), effective Plant Area Index (PAIe), and clumping. This development was boosted not only by a rapid technical advance in the field of digital photography but also by the inherent advantages of DHP for in situ measurements of forest structural attributes. However the major drawback of using DHP for the estimation of forest structural attributes is the lack of standardization which impedes a consistent compatibility with other indirect methods. This lack of standardization is mainly due to uncertainties introduced at the stage of image acquisition and processing. Of these, the determination of optimum exposure and thresholding in the image processing chain are two major influences. In this work influences on the estimation of forest structural attributes, namely the radiometric image resolution, the file format and the image band selection, were studied, in particular with regard to the inter-dependence with exposure and the threshold algorithm applied. For this purpose four different automatic threshold algorithms (Ridler, Otsu, Minimum, Isodata) were tested. Results show that the file format and the image band selection influence the estimation of gap fraction, PAIe and clumping indices. The magnitude of this effect however varies with the threshold algorithm applied, i.e. with a strong effect for the Minimum and Isodata algorithms and little effect for the Ridler and Otsu algorithms. The radiometric image resolution was found to cause only a marginal effect. Based on a comparison with LAI-2000 measurements it could also be demonstrated that the file format and the image band selection affect the determination of the optimum exposure. To resolve these issues an efficient approach to standardizing the processing of hemispherical images is proposed. This approach constitutes the stacking of five differently exposed hemispherical images and passing them to an automated clustering algorithm (Isodata) with the subsequent generation of gap fraction images. The resulting PAIe estimation performs better than or comparably to the estimation based on optimally exposed single images. In addition to being robust and objective, our approach provides consistent compatibility with the LAI-2000.},

	abstract = {A method has been developed to improve estimates of leaf area index determined from hemispherical images of plant canopies. The approach used has been to modify existing techniques for analysis of gap fraction at a range of zenith angles. Conventional analytical techniques determine the gap fraction for a number of concentric annuli and then calculate the logarithm of this quantity. This approach requires the assumption that all foliage elements are randomly arranged within each annulus. The new approach divides each annulus into a number of small segments. The gap fraction of each segment is calculated and the average of their logarithms is calculated for each annulus (log-average or segmented method). These values are then used for the analysis of leaf area index and mean leaf angle using conventional techniques. Leaf area index estimates from hemispherical images were compared with data from a destructive harvest of a sparse canopy of Gliricidia sepium in Mexico. The log-average method was shown to significantly reduce the underestimation of leaf area index obtained from analysis of hemispherical images of clumped canopies. Conventional analysis of hemispherical images resulted in an underestimate of 50\% compared to the destructive harvest. The segmented analysis reduced this to 15\%. A comparison of the conventional and segmented analysis of hemispherical canopy images led to the development of a simple clumping factor calculated as the ratio of segmented and conventional estimates of leaf area index. This variation was found to vary between samples and location. For a canopy of Quercus pubescens in Scotland, the clumping factor was found to vary between 1.20 and 1.75, being highest under sparse canopies. This was attributed to the effects of tree spacing and the presence of a number of canopy gaps in the forest. Thus alternative methods that apply a uniform correct factor to conventional analysis may produce erroneous results where the scale of clumping is not uniform throughout the canopy.},

	abstract = {One of the crucial steps in image processing is the thresholding, meaning the image segmentation needed to separate the foreground (canopy) from the background (sky). Due to the plethora of factors affecting image grey levels (lens vignetting, gamma correction, heterogeneity of sky irradiance, etc.), with current thresholding procedures the estimation of canopy gap fraction is rather uncertain. Both manual and automatic segmentation methods are highly dependent on exposure, operator experience or assumptions of thresholding algorithms, and therefore produce rather subjective and non-repeatable results. However, since CCD and CMOS sensors used in digital cameras respond linearly to light, it is nowadays possible to obtain images in which digital numbers are proportional to canopy brightness. For this purpose the standard in-camera logarithmic conversion (gamma correction) has to be replaced with a linear conversion of the sensor analog signal. In this work, the potential of the linear conversion of digital images in the estimation of canopy gap fraction is assessed and discussed, comparing the estimates obtained with digital cameras and with the LI-COR LAI-2000. In addition, the performance of the linear conversion is compared with standard automatic or manual thresholding methods, both in terms of canopy gap fraction and of plant architectural parameters. The ability to acquire hemispherical photographs with digital numbers proportional to radiance opens new possibilities in the analysis of canopy structure and microclimate, with important feedbacks in ecology and remote sensing. In particular, using two synchronized cameras above and below the canopy, it is possible to calculate high-resolution gap fraction data, which provide an accurate and objective estimation of the intercepted radiation and of typical architectural parameters, such as LAI. In addition, the effectiveness of this methodology for the estimation of linear and logarithmic averages of canopy gap fraction, makes this technique an important step forward in the estimation of leaf area index of non-random canopies.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the issue of segmentation methods in hemispherical photography determining diffuse site factor (DIFFSF) and leaf inclination angle distribution in forest stands simultaneously. Field inclination angle distributions were sampled in pure stands of European beech, hornbeam, sessile oak and silver birch on sites where towers facilitated crown access. In the same stands leaf litter traps were placed from which LAI values were derived after autumn leaf fall. Analogue hemispherical photographs were taken in summer before leaf fall. We combined the ellipsoidal G-function and Markov–Poisson model to invert leaf inclination angle functions (LIDF). Field leaf inclination angle distributions were planophile for three species and plagiophile for birch. The planophile distributions were well represented by ellipsoidal as well as beta distribution while plagiophile distribution of birch was exclusively represented by beta distribution. When segmentation methods were varied, LIDF parameter predictions were more in correspondence with field values by using sub-pixel methods than by using binary methods. When integrating vignetting properties into the segmentation algorithm or when accounting for standard sky luminance distribution, the accuracy of LIDF predictions varied; it is assumed that this is due to variation in sky properties during photography. Thus, different segmentation techniques in hemispherical photography did not yield constancy in deriving different required variables, i.e. DIFFSF and LIDF. Rather, method of segmentation affects leaf inclination angle estimation.},

	abstract = {The analysis of classified hemispherical images of forest stands is a common method in forestry to determine site-related factors for plants. A segmentation of hemispheric images, followed by an intersection with the daily and annual path of the sun, provides a quantitative measure on the solar radiation conditions for young plants. For that purpose reliably classified images have to be generated. The paper describes a method for the sub-pixel classification of hemispherical canopy images. The goal was to develop an automatic method which allows classifying canopy images independent of the type and density of the forest stand and the sky cover. The procedure can be divided into two steps. First the pixels that purely represent the classes sky or vegetation are determined. This is done by analysing radial grey value profiles corresponding to the homogeneity of neighbouring pixels. Inhomogeneous regions usually define border pixels between the two classes. In addition to this texture criterion the multi-spectral information is considered insofar as a pixel can be identified unambiguously as a pure vegetation pixel by its RGB-values. In a second step the remaining unclassified mixed pixels are assigned to these two classes. For that purpose the percentage ratio of each class is determined for each mixed pixel. 1.},

	abstract = {A correct exposure is of crucial importance for accurate retrieval of canopy parameters using hemispherical photograph techniques. Digital hemispherical photographs were collected under different sky brightness conditions using a Nikon CoolPix 4500 camera with an FC-E8 fish-eye lens for canopies of different species and openness. Different exposure schemes were employed to investigate the effects of photographic exposure on the estimations of the effective leaf area index (Le) and gap fraction. The contrast between the sky and foliage under each exposure scheme was calculated to determine the correct exposure under different weather conditions. The results demonstrated that digital hemispherical photographs taken with automatic exposure are not reliable, causing Le underestimations by 16–71\% for medium and high density canopies (Le=3.2–4.8) and corresponding gap fraction overestimations by 18–72\%. While for open canopies with Le{\textless}1.26, Le was overestimated by 11–29\%, and the corresponding gap fraction was underestimated by 4–28\%. Studies showed that increasing one stop of exposure results in 3–28\% differences in Le for canopies with different openness. Based on the analysis, we determined the optimum exposure and developed a protocol for acquiring digital hemispherical photographs. The protocol requires first measuring reference exposure for the open sky using a built-in camera light meter, and then take photographs inside the canopy using the same camera with two stops of more exposure than the reference exposure in order to make the sky appear white and consequently also maximize the contrast between the sky and foliage. This protocol is applicable for different sky brightness and for different canopy openness. In dense canopies, this procedure requires much less exposure than automatic exposure, but in very open canopies, this procedure requires more exposure than automatic exposure. Using the exposure determined with this procedure rather than the automatic exposure, the comparison of Le values from the LAI-2000 and digital photographs is greatly improved, with R2 increasing from 0.77 to 0.95, and RMSE decreasing from 1.29 to 0.38.},

We show that the automatic threshold algorithm is appropriate to replace the widely used manual interactive processing. It also improves the accuracy of results, especially in comparison with single manual thresholding.

	abstract = {Canopy structural parameters are often used to give adequate representation of vegetated ecosystems for various purposes including primary productivity, climate system, water and carbon gas exchanges, and radiation extinction. Canopy structural parameters are usually described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile. Here we clarify concepts that have been used for fractional canopy element cover and openness measures. The fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover, canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element cover and openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy element cover and openness parameters can be estimated with a few point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element cover and openness. Most of the commonly and interchangeably used concepts of fractional canopy element cover and openness measures represent physically different structural properties of a vegetated ecosystem.},

In March 2000, we collected near-synoptic vegetation structural data at five sites spanning the Kalahari's large precipitation gradient (about 300–1000 mm yr−1) from southern Botswana (∼24°S) to Zambia (∼15°S). All sites were within the expansive Kalahari sandsheet. Common parameters, including plant area index (PAI), leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover (CC), were measured or derived using several indirect instruments and at multiple spatial scales. Results show that CC and PAI increase with increasing mean annual precipitation. Canopy clumping, defined by the deviation of the gap size distribution from that of randomly distributed foliage, was fairly constant along the gradient. We provide empirical relationships relating these parameters to each other and to precipitation. These results, combined with those in companion Kalahari Transect studies, provide a unique and coherent test bed for ecological modeling. The data may be used to parameterize process models, as well as test internally predicted parameters and their variability in response to well-characterized climatological differences.},

The value of optical LAI measurements by means of hemispherical photography has already been demonstrated in previous studies.

	abstract = {Digital hemispherical photography is an effective device for estimating the light environment beneath a forest canopy. In this study, the effects of different image quality, size and camera type on the light environment estimates using digital hemispherical photography were examined. Using two digital cameras, Coolpix 900 and 990, with the exclusive fish-eye converter FC-E8, we took hemispherical photographs of all selectable combinations of image quality and size in 15 stands with various light environments, and then estimated the gap fraction and canopy openness. The estimates made using the two cameras did not differ with the image quality. By contrast, the estimates made with Coolpix 900 differed in image size, but not those made with Coolpix 990. These results suggested that the basic-quality and full-size image was adequate for Coolpix 900, whereas the basic-quality and VGA-size was the optimum combination for Coolpix 990. Comparison of the best combination images between two cameras showed that the Coolpix 900 produced significantly higher gap fraction and canopy openness than Coolpix 990. It is therefore necessary to state clearly the type of camera used in further studies, so that the results obtained from a different camera could be compared. In conclusion, although digital hemispherical photography would be a convenient means for estimating light environments, we should pay attention to the effects of image size and camera type presented in this study.},

	abstract = {In-situ estimations of leaf area index (LAI), leaf clumping, and leaf angular distribution are often performed from canopy gap fraction measurements with optical sensors. Two new procedures are used in this study to improve the estimation of gap fraction from digital camera photographs,: 1) the digital number (DN) of mixed sky-canopy pixels is used to estimate the within pixel gap fraction instead of the usual threshold used to separate a pixel in gap or a foliage pixel, and 2), the within pixel gap fraction is calculated at different view zenith and azimuth angles to take into account multiple scattering effects. To estimate foliage clumping, a gap size distribution is calculated from a narrow view zenith angle range (less than 1/spl deg/). The clumping index is then extracted using 3 methods: 1) a refined gap size distribution theory developed for the TRAC instruments; 2) the Lang and Xiang (1986) logarithm gap fraction averaging and 3) a combination of 1) and 2). Clumping index variations with view zenith angle in the range from 15/spl deg/ to 70/spl deg/ are derived using the individual and combined methods. Analysis of the digital hemispherical photographs shows that 1) the three methods give different clumping estimates, but the angular variation patterns are similar, and 2) canopies with significant angular variation in clumping can induce large errors in the inverted leaf angle distribution when the clumping angular variation is not included in the retrieval. The practical implication of these findings is that LAI, clumping index, and foliage orientation can all be reliably retrieved using digital hemispherical photographs, considerably reducing the number and cost of instruments needed in fieldwork.},

	abstract = {When analysing hemispherical photographs taken from forest stands the grey value of the smallest picture unit — so-called ‘pixel’ — is taken as a measure of transmissivity. This derived information of transmission is based on the grey value of unobscured pixels which serves as a reference value. However, a particular grey value of unobscured pixels is actually not constant for all pixels of a photograph; but is influenced by (i) sky luminance heterogeneity and (ii) vignetting properties of lenses. A method to assess the two factors mentioned is proposed. This method takes into account the film-specific relation between received relative radiation energy and the films grey value. The relation is constant for a particular film and can be determined by photographing an optical density wedge on each film. The method is applied in vignetting measurements on two custom ‘fisheye’ lenses which reveal significant differences in the properties of the lenses as well as for particular aperture openings. Consecutive relative radiance measurements on photographs taken under overcast skies gave consistent sky luminance distributions with this method compared to standard distributions from literature. Moreover, the method gives reasonable relative radiance values from photographs of increasing degree of over-exposure taken under identical skies. An instruction for deriving zenith angle dependent reference values for unobscured sky within one single photograph taken on an overcast day is given which can also be applied to digital camera device.},

	abstract = {Due to the scarcity and high cost of conventional film-based hemispherical photographic systems, some forest scientists are now using multi-purpose, consumer-grade digital cameras for the analysis of forest canopy structure and gap light transmission. Although the low cost of digital cameras and direct capture of digital images appear to offer significant advantages over film camera systems, relatively little is known about their technical differences from an applications perspective. In this study, we compared the performance of a popular digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 950 with FC-E8 fisheye) with a conventional film camera (Nikon F with Nikkor 8mm fisheye) under different stand structures and sky conditions. Our findings show that the Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera produced hemispherical canopy photos with substantial color blurring towards the periphery of the exposure. We believe that chromatic aberration associated with the camera’s lens optics may be the source of this phenomenon; however, other factors may have also contributed to the diminished image sharpness. Color blur influenced (i) the size, shape, and distribution of canopy gaps; (ii) the accuracy of edge detection and the binary division of pixels into sky and canopy elements, and (iii) the magnitude, range, and replication of canopy openness, leaf area, and transmitted global radiation results. The Nikon Coolpix 950 produced canopy openness measures that were 1.4 times greater than film estimates in 22 of the 36 photo pairs. Cloud cover and sky brightness also influenced the spectral characteristics of the lateral chromatic aberration (halos), and thus had an added and unpredictable effect on canopy openness. Setting the Nikon Coolpix 950 to record in black and white, and shooting only under uniformly overcast skies will help to minimize the unpredictable effects of chromatic aberration. Nevertheless, we recommend a cautious approach when undertaking canopy measurements with the Nikon Coolpix 950, particularly when stands are dense and canopy openness falls below 10\%. High-quality (1:4) JPEG compression had no significant influence on mean canopy openness; however, lower XGA and VGA image resolutions combined with 1:4 JPEG compression produced mean canopy openness results that were significantly lower than openness data extracted from uncompressed, full-resolution TIFF photos.},

However, calibration problems repeatedly arise concerning the grey-value information of the photographs. This article introduces a method which may help to solve these calibration problems. The method takes into consideration two information transport media (black-and-white film and digital image analysis). This method is based on the exposure of the photographs to the zenith luminance of an overcast sky and the determination of the gamma function of the film by means of an optical density wedge photograph. By taking these characteristics into account, it is possible to obtain reproducible and bias-free results from the diffuse site factor even with different film materials. Moreover, the modelling of penumbral effects is shown. Limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {Automatic thresholding of the gray-level values of an image is very useful in automated analysis of morphological images, and it represents the first step in many applications in image understanding. Recently it was shown that by choosing the threshold as the value that maximizes the entropy of the 1-dimensional histogram of an image, one might be able to separate, effectively, the desired objects from the background. This approach, however, does not take into consideration the spatial correlation between the pixels in an image. Thus, the performance might degrade rapidly as the spatial interaction between pixels becomes more dominant than the gray-level values. In this case, it becomes difficult to isolate the object from the background and human interference might be required. This was observed during studies that involved images of the stomach. The objective of this report is to extend the entropy-based thresholding algorithm to the 2-dimensional histogram. In this approach, the gray-level value of each pixel as well as the average value of its immediate neighborhood is studied. Thus, the threshold is a vector and has two entries: the gray level of the pixel and the average gray level of its neighborhood. The vector that maximizes the 2-dimensional entropy is used as the 2-dimensional threshold. This method was then compared to the conventional 1-dimensional entropy-based method. Several images were synthesized and others were obtained from the hospital files that represent images of the stomach of patients. It was found that the proposed approach performs better specially when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is decreased. Both, as expected, yielded good results when the SNR was high (more than 12 dB).},

The foliage angle can be estimated by comparing the numbers of contacts made by quadrats inclined at two different angles, but this estimate is less satisfactory than one based on vertical and horizontal quadrats. Accurate estimates of both foliage area and foliage angle can be obtained by using a combination of vertical, inclined, and horizontal quadrats.

	abstract = {This paper reviews recently published literature, most of which was published in Chinese, and searches for regional patterns of Holocene changes useful in depicting global patterns. The Holocene in the Xinjiang region can be divided into three stages: a warming and dry early stage (from 11 10 to 8-7 ka BP), a warm and wet middle stage (from 8-7 to 4.5-3 ka BP) and a fluctuating cool and dry late stage (since 4.5-3 ka BP). The Holocene in the northern Tibetan Plateau can also be divided into three stages: a warming and wet stage (from 10.5-10 to 5-4 ka BP), followed by a variable drying and probably warm stage (5-4 to 3 ka BP) and ending with a cool and dry stage (since 3 ka BP). In the Inner Mongolian Plateau, the early Holocene (from 10.5-9.5 to 8-7.5 ka BP) was warming and dry, and a warm and wet climate occurred from 7.5 to 3.5, during which the best time was 6.3-3.8 ka BP; the climate has been variably drying and probably cooling since 3.5 ka BP. In the northwestern part of the Loess Plateau, several Holocene palaeosols have been identified (10-9, 7.5-5, 4-3 and 2.7-2 ka BP) with the 7.5-5 ka BP palaeosol being most strongly expressed. The best-developed palaeosol-equivalent in major valleys is a swamp-wetland facies deposited between 8885 and 3805 14C yr BP under an extremely wet regime. The climate has fluctuated significantly at least three times around a dry and probably cool regime after the swamp-wetland facies-depositional period. Our summary shows that the Holocene Climatic Optimum occurred nearly contemporaneously (8-5 ka BP) at all sites in the Xinjiang region, in the Inner Mongolian Plateau and in the northwestern part of the Loess Plateau. A warming and wet early Holocene (10-8 ka BP) in the northern Tibetan Plateau is most likely related to high effective soil moisture resulting from snow and ice melting. We propose here that the middle Holocene Climatic Optimum (8-5 ka BP) in arid to semi-arid China was primarily a delayed response of the low latitude oceans to high latitude peak insolation (9-8 ka BP).},

Because of payload capacity restrictions, off-the-shelf digital cameras are widely used on medium and small sized UAVs. The limitation of low spectral resolution in digital cameras for vegetation mapping can be reduced by incorporating texture features and robust classifiers. Random Forest has been widely used in satellite remote sensing applications, but its usage in UAV image classification has not been well documented. The objectives of this paper were to propose a hybrid method using Random Forest and texture analysis to accurately differentiate land covers of urban vegetated areas, and analyze how classification accuracy changes with texture window size. Six least correlated second-order texture measures were calculated at nine different window sizes and added to original Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images as ancillary data. A Random Forest classifier consisting of 200 decision trees was used for classification in the spectral-textural feature space. Results indicated the following: (1) Random Forest outperformed traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier and showed similar performance to object-based image analysis in urban vegetation classification; (2) the inclusion of texture features improved classification accuracy significantly; (3) classification accuracy followed an inverted U relationship with texture window size. The results demonstrate that UAV provides an efficient and ideal platform for urban vegetation mapping. The hybrid method proposed in this paper shows good performance in differentiating urban vegetation mapping. The drawbacks of off-the-shelf digital cameras can be reduced by adopting Random Forest and texture analysis at the same time.},

Rapid advances in miniature sensor technology are leading to greater potentials for ecological research. We demonstrate one of the first applications of UAV lidar and hyperspectral imagery and a fusion method for individual plant species identification and 3D characterization at submeter scales in south-eastern Arizona, USA. The UAV lidar scanner characterized the individual vegetation canopy structure and bare ground elevation, whereas the hyperspectral sensor provided species-specific spectral signatures for the dominant and target species at our study area in leaf-on condition. We hypothesized that the fusion of the two different data sources would perform better than either data type alone in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems with sparse vegetation. The fusion approach provides 84–89\% overall accuracy (kappa values of 0.80–0.86) in target species classification at the canopy scale, leveraging a wide range of target spectral responses in the hyperspectral data and a high point density (50 points/m2) in the lidar data. In comparison, the hyperspectral image classification alone produced 72–76\% overall accuracies (kappa values of 0.70 and 0.71). The UAV lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM) is also strongly correlated with manned airborne lidar-derived DEM (R2 = 0.98 and 0.96), but was obtained at a lower cost. The lidar and hyperspectral data as well as the fusion method demonstrated here can be widely applied across a gradient of vegetation and topography to monitor and detect ecological changes at a local scale.},

In this study, we used a small UAS equipped with a compact digital camera which has been calibrated and modified to record not only the visual but also the near infrared reflection (NIR) of possibly infested oaks. The flight campaigns were realized in August 2013, covering two study sites which are located in a rural area in western Germany. Both locations represent small-scale, privately managed commercial forests in which oaks are economically valuable species. Our workflow includes the CIR/NIR image acquisition, mosaicking, georeferencing and pixel-based image enhancement followed by object-based image classification techniques. A modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImod) derived classification was used to distinguish between five vegetation health classes, i.e., infested, healthy or dead branches, other vegetation and canopy gaps. We achieved an overall Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.81 and 0.77 for each study site, respectively.

Increased frequency and intensity of insect induced forest disturbance has established a new demand for effective methods suitable in mapping and monitoring tasks. In this investigation, a novel miniaturized hyperspectral frame imaging sensor operating in the wavelength range of 500–900 nm was used to identify mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation, representing a different outbreak phase, by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We developed a new processing method for analyzing spectral characteristic for high spatial resolution photogrammetric and hyperspectral images in forested environments, as well as for identifying individual anomalous trees. The dense point clouds, measured using image matching, enabled detection of single trees with an accuracy of 74.7\%. We classified the trees into classes of healthy, infested and dead, and the results were promising. The best results for the overall accuracy were 76\% (Cohen’s kappa 0.60), when using three color classes (healthy, infested, dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead), the best overall accuracy was 90\% (kappa 0.80).

Significant research has focussed on assessing forest health using remotely sensed data from satellites and manned aircraft. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may provide new tools for improved forest health monitoring by providing data with very high temporal and spatial resolutions. These platforms also pose unique challenges and methods for health assessments must be validated before use. In this research, we simulated a disease outbreak in mature Pinus radiata D. Don trees using targeted application of herbicide. The objective was to acquire a time-series simulated disease expression dataset to develop methods for monitoring physiological stress from a UAV platform. Time-series multi-spectral imagery was acquired using a UAV flown over a trial at regular intervals. Traditional field-based health assessments of crown health (density) and needle health (discolouration) were carried out simultaneously by experienced forest health experts. Our results showed that multi-spectral imagery collected from a UAV is useful for identifying physiological stress in mature plantation trees even during the early stages of tree stress. We found that physiological stress could be detected earliest in data from the red edge and near infra-red bands. In contrast to previous findings, red edge data did not offer earlier detection of physiological stress than the near infra-red data. A non-parametric approach was used to model physiological stress based on spectral indices and was found to provide good classification accuracy (weighted kappa=0.694). This model can be used to map physiological stress based on high-resolution multi-spectral data.},

	abstract = {In Taiwan, the average annual rainfall is about 2,500 mm, about three 
times the world average. Hill slopes where are mostly under meta-stable
conditions due to fragmented surface materials can easily be disturbed
by heavy typhoon rainfall and/or earthquakes, resulting in landslides
and debris flows. Thus, an efficient data acquisition and disaster
surveying method is critical for decision making. Comparing with
satellite and airplane, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a portable
and dynamic platform for data acquisition. In particularly when a small
target area is required. In this study, a fixed-wing UAV that equipped
with a consumer grade digital camera, i.e. Canon EOS 450D, a flight
control computer, a Garmin GPS receiver and an attitude heading
reference system (AHRS) are proposed. The adopted UAV has about two
hours flight duration time with a flight control range of 20 km and has
a payload of 3 kg, which is suitable for a medium scale mapping and
surveying mission. In the paper, a test area with 21.3 km2 in
size containing hundreds of landslides induced by Typhoon Morakot is
used for landslides mapping. The flight height is around 1,400 meters
and the ground sampling distance of the acquired imagery is about 17 cm.
The aerial triangulation, ortho-image generation and mosaicking are
applied to the acquired images in advance. An automatic landslides
detection algorithm is proposed based on the object-based image analysis
(OBIA) technique. The color ortho-image and a digital elevation model
(DEM) are used. The ortho-images before and after typhoon are utilized
to estimate new landslide regions. Experimental results show that the
developed algorithm can achieve a producer's accuracy up to 91\%, user's
accuracy 84\%, and a Kappa index of 0.87. It demonstrates the feasibility
of the landslide detection algorithm and the applicability of a
fixed-wing UAV for landslide mapping.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT  This paper presents a portable vision system for forest surveying that can estimate the diameter of a target tree with a single "point and click". Of specific interest is the texture segmentation algorithm used for accurately determining the boundaries of the target tree in a forest. This segmentation is challenging because the target may be occluding other, almost identical looking trees, creating an obscure edge. To compensate for this possibility, we have created an algorithm sensitive to small texture changes which uses both the co-occurrence matrix and the Mahalanobis metric to first find a window that must contain the target texture edge. Then, the edge is precisely localized in this window using a novel method based on co-occurrence matrix differences. Using this algorithm, given no structured shadows, we have been able to achieve consistent accuracies of +/- 1 inch, or less than 5\% error, in both simulated tests and a field trial. iv v Table of Contents 1.0 Introduction ....},

The time required for the measure and the data entry of diameters to computer for each instrument was also evaluated. Significant differences in mean DBH (diameter outside bark at breast height — 1.3 m above ground) generally occurred among instruments. Nevertheless, even if these differences were significant, they were less than 1 cm for five of the six species tested. For white pine (Pinus strobus L.), however, the use of the ETMF without reflector led to an important overestimation of the DBH in comparison to the caliper, the diameter tape and the ETMF with reflector. The typical fissured bark observed on white pines could probably explain that overestimation. For all species, the addition of the reflector to the ETMF decreased the differences among instruments. The measures taken with the diameter tape were slightly larger than those made with the caliper. In comparison to the diameter tape and the caliper, the ETMF reduced the time required for date collection from 35 to 45\%. Key words: diameter measurement, timber inventory},

Aims

We aim to value the accuracy of information derived from different remote sensing sensors (airborne laser scanning, aerial multispectral and hyperspectral imagery) and four alternative forest inventory approaches.
Methods

The approaches were (1) mean values or (2) diameter distributions both obtained by the area-based approach (ABA), (3) individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation and (4) an approach called semi-individual tree crown (SITC) segmentation. The estimated tree information was assessed and used to evaluate how erroneous inventory data affect economic value and loss due to suboptimal harvesting decisions. Field measured data used as reference come from 23 field plots collected in a study area in south-eastern Norway typical of managed boreal forests in Norway.
Results

The accuracy of the forest inventory was generally in line with previous studies. Our results show that using mean values from the area-based approach may yield large economic losses, while adding a diameter distribution to the area-based approach yielded less loss than the individual tree crown methods. Adding information from imagery had little effect on the results.
Conclusions

Taking inventory costs into account, diameter distributions from the area-based approach without additional information seems favourable.},

We investigated the influence of camera lens, tree species, and height of diameter on the accuracy of the tree perimeter and diameter estimation. Furthermore, we investigated the variance of the perimeter and diameter reference measurements. We chose four tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. and Abies alba Mill.). The perimeters and diameters were measured at three height levels (0.8 m, 1.3 m, and 1.8 m) and two types of lenses were used. The data acquisition followed a circle around the tree at a 3 m radius. The highest accuracy of the perimeter estimation was achieved when a fisheye lens was used at a height of 1.3 m for Fagus sylvatica (root mean square error of 0.25 cm). Alternatively, the worst accuracy was achieved when a non-fisheye lens was used at 1.3 m for Quercus petraea (root mean square error of 1.27 cm). The tree species affected the estimation accuracy for both diameters and perimeters.},

	abstract = {Enriching forest resource inventory is important to ensure the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Obtaining forest inventory data from the field has always been difficult, laborious, time consuming, and expensive. Advances in integrating photogrammetry and computer vision have helped researchers develop some numeric algorithms and methods that can turn 2D (images) into 3D (point clouds) and are highly applicable to forestry. This paper aimed to develop a new, highly accurate methodology that extracts sample plot parameters based on continuous terrestrial photogrammetry. For this purpose, we designed and implemented a terrestrial observation instrument combining real-time kinematic (RTK) and charge-coupled device (CCD) continuous photography. Then, according to the set observation plan, three independent experimental plots were continuously photographed and the 3D point cloud of the plot was generated. From this 3D point cloud, the tree position coordinates, tree DBHs, tree heights, and other plot characteristics of the forest were extracted. The plot characteristics obtained from the 3D point cloud were compared with the measurement data obtained from the field to check the accuracy of our methodology. We obtained the position coordinates of the trees with the positioning accuracy (RMSE) of 0.162 m to 0.201 m. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the trunk diameter measurements was 3.07\% to 4.51\%, which met the accuracy requirements of traditional forestry surveys. The hypsometrical measurements were due to the occlusion of the forest canopy and the estimated rRMSE was 11.26\% to 11.91\%, which is still good reference data. Furthermore, these image-based point cloud data also have portable observation instruments, low data collection costs, high field measurement efficiency, automatic data processing, and they can directly extract tree geographic location information, which may be interesting and important for certain applications such as the protection of registered famous trees. For forest inventory, continuous terrestrial photogrammetry with its unique advantages is a solution that deserves future attention in the field of tree detection and ecological construction.},

Accurate data can be extracted to enable the measurement of tree trunks or branches. The images that are collected with this technique can be oriented in photogrammetric software (using fisheye models) and used to generate dense point clouds, provided that some constraints on the camera positions are adopted. A set of images was captured in a forest plot in the experiments. Weighted geometric constraints were imposed in the photogrammetric software to calculate the image orientation, perform dense image matching, and accurately generate a 3D point cloud. The tree trunks in the scenes were reconstructed and mapped in a local reference system. The accuracy assessment was based on differences between measured and estimated trunk diameters at different heights. Trunk sections from an image-based point cloud were also compared to the corresponding sections that were extracted from a dense terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point cloud. Cylindrical fitting of the trunk sections allowed the assessment of the accuracies of the trunk geometric shapes in both clouds. The average difference between the cylinders that were fitted to the photogrammetric cloud and those to the TLS cloud was less than 1 cm, which indicates the potential of the proposed technique. The point densities that were obtained with vertical optical scanning were 1/3 less than those that were obtained with TLS. However, the point density can be improved by using higher resolution cameras.},

Distinguishable points from the stem surface are automatically extracted in the images, and their 3D ground coordinates are determined by bundle adjustment. The XY coordinates of each stem define an arc shape, and these points are used as observations in a circle fitting by least squares. The circle centre determines the tree position in a local reference system, and the estimated radius is used to calculate the DBH. Experiments were performed in a sample plot to assess the approach and compare it with a technique based on terrestrial laser scanning.

Despite the relative accuracy (relative geometrical distortion) of the reconstructions available in the processing software, the absolute accuracy is uncertain and difficult to evaluate. We evaluated the data collected by a common digital camera through the processing software (Agisoft PhotoScan ©) for photogrammetry by comparing those by direct measurement of the 3D magnetic motion tracker. Our analyses indicated that the error is mostly concentrated in the portions of the tree where visibility is lower, i.e., the bottom and upper parts of the stem. For each reference point from the digitizer we determined how many cameras could view this point. With a greater number of cameras we found increasing accuracy of the measured object space point positions (as expected), with a significant positive change in the trend beyond five cameras; when more than five cameras could view this point, the accuracy began to increase more abruptly, but eight cameras or more provided no increases in accuracy. This method allows for the retrieval of larger datasets from the measurements, which could improve the accuracy of estimates of 3D structure of trees at potentially reduced costs.},

Thirty small, potted trees were photographed and measured with traditional dendrometry to evaluate SfM-MVS derived tree size estimates. Tree volume was obtained via the water displacement approach xylometry. SfM-MVS estimates of 2D tree metrics had errors (RMSE – root mean squared error) as low as 3.74\% (RMSEtreeheight=3.74\%, RMSEcrowndepth=11.93\%, RMSEcrownspread=14.76\%, RMSEDBH=9.6\%). SfM-MVS estimates of 3D tree metrics were better for the main stem than for the slender branches (RMSEStem=12.33\%, RMSEBranches=47.53\%, RMSETotalVolume=18.53\%). Apart from height and crown depth, all modelled variables had negative bias, suggesting that SfM-MVS tends to underestimate the size of trees. The results show that SfM-MVS is capable of producing estimates of 2D and 3D metrics with accuracy comparable to that of laser scanning (i.e. LiDAR). Factors like the position of the tree relative to its surroundings, the background scene and the ambient lighting, appear to affect model success. SfM-MVS provides a low-cost alternative to remote sensing technologies currently used such as terrestrial laser scanning and, as no specialised equipment is required, it is able to be used by people with little expertise or training. Future research is required for exploring the suitability of SfM-MVS for specific applications requiring accurate dendrometry.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel photogrammetric method for field plot inventory, designed for simplicity and time efficiency on-site. A prototype multi-camera rig was used to acquire images from field plot centers in multiple directions. The acquisition time on-site was less than two minutes. From each view, a point cloud was generated using a novel, rig-based matching of detected SIFT keypoints. Stems were detected in the merged point cloud, and their positions and diameters were estimated. The method was evaluated on 25 hemi-boreal forest plots of a 10-m radius. Due to difficult lighting conditions and faulty hardware, imagery from only six field plots was processed. The method performed best on three plots with clearly visible stems with a 76\% detection rate and 0\% commission. Diameters could be estimated for 40\% of the stems with an RMSE of 2.8–9.5 cm. The results are comparable to other camera-based methods evaluated in a similar manner. The results are inferior to TLS-based methods. However, our method is easily extended to multiple station image schemas, something that could significantly improve the results while retaining low commission errors and time on-site. Furthermore, with smaller hardware, we believe this could be a useful technique for measuring stem attributes in the forest.},

	abstract = {Stereo images have long been the main practical data source for the high-accuracy retrieval of 3-D information over large areas. However, stereoscopy has been surpassed by laser scanning (LS) techniques in recent years, particularly in forested areas, because the reflection of laser points from object surfaces directly provides 3-D geometric features and because the laser beam has good penetration capacity through forest canopies. In the last few years, image-based point clouds have become a more widely available data source because of advances in matching algorithms and computer hardware. This paper explores the possibility of using consumer cameras for forest field data collection and presents an application of terrestrial image-based point clouds derived from a handheld camera to forest plot inventories. In the experiment, the sample forest plot was photographed in a stop-and-go mode using different routes and camera settings. Five data sets were generated from photographs taken in the field, representing different photographic conditions. The stem detection accuracy ranged between 60\% and 84\%, and the root-mean-square errors of the estimated diameters at breast height were between 2.98 and 6.79 cm. The performance of image-based point clouds in forest data collection was compared with that of point clouds derived from two LS techniques, i.e., terrestrial LS (the professional level) and personal LS (an emerging technology). The study indicates that the construction of image-based point clouds of forest field data requires only low-cost, low-weight, and easy-to-use equipment and automated data processing. Photographic measurement is easy and relatively fast. The accuracy of tree attribute estimates is close to an acceptable level for forest field inventory but is lower than that achieved with the tested LS techniques.},

	abstract = {Sustainable forest management requires knowledge of forest structure and dynamics as well as an estimation of growing stock. The forest inventory provides the data for estimating stand variables. The measurement device MU2005-01738, patented by the Center for Forest Research (INIA-CIFOR), provides stereoscopic hemispherical images which can allow the 3D restoration of the stand around the sampling point. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology for forest stand mapping as well as tree diameter and height measurement along with volume estimation from the stereoscopic hemispherical images provided by the MU2005-01738. Using the MU2005-01738, Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations were sampled. Distance, diameter, height and volume were derived from the stereoscopic hemispherical images of 30 trees located at distances ranging from 0 to 15 m from the device. These variables were then compared with field measurements and the estimation errors analyzed. The (root-mean-squared error) RMSE was 0.23 m (8.95 \%) for tree position and 1.51 cm (10.43 \%) for diameter at breast height measurement at distances of less than 8 m. In the case of stem height and individual tree volume estimation, the RMSE was 2.59 m (23.05 \%) and 0.025 m3 (17.94 \%), respectively. The analysis of measurement errors indicated that the measurement precision decreases beyond 8 m from the device as well as for directions close to the baseline (the line between the optical centers of the two images), whereas the precision was highest for directions near to the line which is perpendicular to the base line. Future research should focus on improving measurement accuracy and possible applications in the field of forestry of the techniques presented in this study.},

	abstract = {Vertical point sampling with a digital camera (VPSC) is a promising new forest sampling method that can be used to improve existing sampling protocols or rapidly assess forest structure over large areas. Previous research into VPSC has not accounted for the potential bias that can result from implementing this method on sloping terrain. Here, we present a modified method of conducting VPSC on sloping terrain that maintains unbiased estimates by implementing an automated computer program to adjust for slope at each sample point. This updated method is easily implemented and includes minimal alterations to the existing VPSC protocol, though there will likely be some situations where it is impractical or unnecessary. To address this, we quantified the bias incurred for ignoring slope altogether by conducting a field study in two separate forest types: mixed conifer and mixed deciduous. The coniferous plots showed no slope-related bias whereas the deciduous plots displayed bias on steeper slopes. This difference in bias between forest types is likely due to the difficulty identifying deciduous tree tops in the digital photographs. The lack of discernible bias on the lesser slopes and in the conifer forests was largely due to the slope-related bias being overwhelmed by the unavoidable variability inherent in VPSC. Overall, the slope-related bias should be negligible, regardless of forest type, provided the majority of the sample points fall on slopes of approximately 35° or less. These results further support the use of VPSC as a useful new method of monitoring forest conditions, conducting forest inventories, or assessing wildlife habitat.},

Individual tree stems in the plot were detected and modeled from the image-based point cloud, and the diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) of each tree was estimated. The detected-results were compared with field measurements and with those derived from the single-scan terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. The experiment showed that the mapping accuracy was 88\% and the root mean squared error of DBH estimates of individual trees was 2.39 cm, which is acceptable for practical applications and was similar to the results achieved using TLS. The main advantages of the image-based point cloud data lie in the low cost of the equipment required for the data collection, the simple and fast field measurements and the automated data processing, which may be interesting and important for certain applications, such as field inventories by landowners who do not have supports from external experts.

	abstract = {Aim Tropical forests have been recognized as important global carbon sinks and sources. However, many uncertainties about the spatial distribution of live tree above-ground biomass (AGB) remain, mostly due to limited availability of AGB field data. Recent studies in the Amazon have already shown the importance of large sample size for accurate AGB gradient analysis. Here we use a large stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB dataset to study and explain their spatial patterns in an Asian tropical forest. Location Borneo, Southeast Asia. Methods We combined stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB data from 83 locations in Borneo with an environmental database containing elevation, climate and soil variables. The Akaike information criterion was used to select models and environmental variables that best explained the observed values of stem density, basal area, community wood density and AGB. These models were used to extrapolate these parameters across Borneo. Results We found that wood density, stem density, basal area and AGB respond significantly, but differentially, to the environment. AGB was only correlated with basal area, but not with stem density and community wood specific gravity. Main conclusions Unlike results from Amazonian forests, soil fertility was an important positive correlate for AGB in Borneo while community wood density, which is a main driver of AGB in the Neotropics, did not correlate with AGB in Borneo. Also, Borneo's average AGB of 457.1 Mg ha−1 was c. 60\% higher than the Amazonian average of 288.6 Mg ha−1. We find evidence that this difference might be partly explained by the high density of large wind-dispersed Dipterocarpaceae in Borneo, which need to be tall and emergent to disperse their seeds. Our results emphasize the importance of Bornean forests as carbon sinks and sources due to their high carbon storage capacity.},

	abstract = {Growth and yield modeling has a long history in forestry. The methods of measuring the growth of stand basal area have evolved from those developed in the U.S.A. and Germany during the last century. Stand basal area modeling has progressed rapidly since the first widely used model was published by the U.S. Forest Service. Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven/even-aged stands using stand-level approaches. The modeling methodology has not only moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based approach but also accommodated a variety of techniques such as: 1) simultaneous equation methods, 2) difference models, 3) artificial neural network techniques, 4) linear/nonlinear regression models, and 5) matrix models. Empirical models using statistical methods were developed to reproduce accurately and precisely field observations. In contrast, process models have a shorter history, developed originally as research and education tools with the aim of increasing the understanding of cause and effect relationships. Empirical and process models can be married into hybrid models in which the shortcomings of both component approaches can, to some extent, be overcome. Algebraic difference forms of stand basal area models which consist of stand age, stand density and site quality can fully describe stand growth dynamics. This paper reviews the current literature regarding stand basal area models, discusses the basic types of models and their merits and outlines recent progress in modeling growth and dynamics of stand basal area. Future trends involving algebraic difference forms, good fitting variables and model types into stand basal area modeling strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {A method of predicting two forest stand structure attributes, basal area and aboveground biomass, from measurements of forest vertical structure was developed and tested using field and remotely sensed canopy structure measurements. Coincident estimates of the vertical distribution of canopy surface area (the canopy height profile), and field-measured stand structure attributes were acquired for two data sets. The chronosequence data set consists of 48 plots in stands distributed within 25 miles of Annapolis, MD, with canopy height profiles measured in the field using the optical-quadrat method. The stem-map data set consists of 75 plots subsetted from a single 32 ha stem-mapped stand, with measurements of their canopy height profiles made using the SLICER (Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery) instrument, an airborne surface lidar system. Four height indices, maximum, median, mean, and quadratic mean canopy height (QMCH) were calculated from the canopy height profiles. Regressions between the indices and stand basal area and biomass were developed using the chronosequence data set. The regression equations developed from the chronosequence data set were then applied to height indices calculated from the remotely sensed canopy height profiles from the stem map data set, and the ability of the regression equations to predict the stem map plot’s stand structure attributes was then evaluated. The QMCH was found to explain the most variance in the chronosequence data set’s stand structure attributes, and to most accurately predict the values of the same attributes in the stem map data set. For the chronosequence data set, the QMCH predicted 70\% of variance in stand basal area, and 80\% of variance in aboveground biomass, and remained nonasymptotic with basal areas up to 50 m2 ha−1, and aboveground biomass values up to 450 Mg ha−1. When applied to the stem-map data set, the regression equations resulted in basal areas that were, on average, underestimated by 2.1 m2 ha−1, and biomass values were underestimated by 16 Mg ha−1, and explained 37\% and 33\% of variance, respectively. Differences in the magnitude of the coefficients of determination were due to the wider range of stand conditions found in the chronosequence data set; the standard deviation of residual values were lower in the stem map data set than on the chronosequence data sets. Stepwise multiple regression was performed to predict the two stand structure attributes using the canopy height profile data directly as independent variables, but they did not improve the accuracy of the estimates over the height index approach.},

The compatible growth estimator associated with the usual basal area estimator has a high variance; a noncompatible growth estimator with less variance is usually preferred. A new compatible estimator is proposed for use with trees selected by the usual Bitterlich sampling procedure. This estimator, which requires some additional measurements, results in an increased variance for basal area estimation and a greatly reduced variance for growth estimation compared to the usual compatible estimation procedure; the latter variance approaches that of the noncompatible growth estimator. A purely random distribution of trees is assumed and deterministic formulas are used to calculate variances. Extensions to volume estimation are discussed.},

For capturing full 360 degree panoramas in a single shot, the Spherical Panoramic Camera (SPC) are gaining in popularity. However, estimating depth from a SPC remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a practical method that generates all-around dense depth map using a narrow-baseline video clip captured by a SPC. While existing methods for depth from small motion rely on perspective cameras, we introduce a new bundle adjustment approach tailored for SPC that minimizes the re-projection error directly on the unit sphere. It enables to estimate approximate metric camera poses and 3D points. Additionally, we present a novel dense matching method called sphere sweeping algorithm. This allows us to take advantage of the overlapping regions between the cameras. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data. As an example of the applications, we also present stereoscopic panorama images generated from our depth results.},

We present a straightforward modification of horizontal line sampling designed to facilitate inventory of these features while remaining compatible with commonly employed sampling methods for the living overstory. The method is simpler in its implementation than traditional horizontal line sampling. We develop unbiased estimators and present methods for dealing with special cases, including boundary overlap. A field test of the method shows it to have time efficiency comparable with or better than ordinary prism cruising, and it requires far fewer sample locations to achieve similar confidence limits. The method may also be useful for inventorying other rare or unusual trees., Les chicots et les arbres avec des cavités sont des éléments structuraux importants dans les forêts mais ils sont souvent dispersés, ce qui les rend difficiles à inventorier de façon efficace. Nous présentons une modification simple de l'échantillonnage en ligne horizontale dans le but de faciliter l'inventaire de ces éléments tout en demeurant compatible avec les méthodes d'échantillonnage communément utilisées pour le couvert formé par les arbres vivants. La méthode est plus simple à appliquer que l'échantillonnage en ligne horizontale traditionnel.

En terme d'investissement en temps, un essai sur le terrain montre que la méthode est aussi efficace, sinon plus, que l'inventaire habituel au prisme et requière beaucoup moins de points d'échantillonnage pour obtenir les mêmes limites de confiance.

We validated retrievals with ground-truth data collected from two sites near Tumbarumba, New South Wales, Australia. In a ponderosa pine plantation, LAI values of 1.84 and 2.18 retrieved by two different methods using a single EVI scan bracketed a value of 1.98 estimated by allometric equations. In a natural, but managed, Eucalypus stand, eight scans provided mean LAI values of 2.28–2.47, depending on the method, which compare favorably with a value of 2.4 from hemispherical photography. The retrieved foliage profile clearly showed two canopy layers. A find-trunks algorithm processed the EVI scans at both sites to identify stems, determine their diameters, and measure their distances from the scan center. Distances were retrieved very accurately (r2 = 0.99). The accuracy of EVI diameter retrieval decreased somewhat with distance as a function of angular resolution of the instrument but remained unbiased. We estimated stand basal area, mean diameter, and stem count density using the Relaskop method of variable radius plot sampling and found agreement with manual Relaskop values within about 2\% after correcting for the obscuring of far trunks by near trunks (occlusion). These early trials prove the potential of under-canopy, upward-scanning lidar to retrieve forest structural parameters quickly and accurately.},

Photo imagery is a promising non-destructivemethod for estimating the aboveground biomass of treeseedlings. This method was tested using naturallyregenerated white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench)Voss) seedlings growing in the understory of a mixedconifer shelterwood in central Ontario. In the fall of1997, 45 seedlings were sampled from plots exposed toone of three mechanical release treatments (earlyspring release, mid summer release, and no release(control)) in 1994. Each seedling was photographed inthe field to measure the vertical projected area(silhouette area) of the aboveground portion of theseedling. Seedlings were harvested, basal diameter andtotal height measured, and biomass (dry mass) offoliage, branches, main stem and total abovegroundplant tissue determined. Regression analysis revealeda strong relationship between both silhouette area andbasal diameter, and seedling biomass. Coefficients ofdetermination for regression equations usingsilhouette area were equal to 0.892, 0.918, 0.926, and0.937 for the main stem, branches, foliage, and totalaboveground biomass, respectively. Respectivecoefficients of determination for regression equationsusing basal diameter were 0.960, 0.945, 0.953, and0.977. Silhouette area-based equations for totalaboveground and foliar biomass differed significantly(P {\textless} 0.005) among release treatments. Nosignificant differences among treatments were observedbetween silhouette area-based equations for biomass ofbranches and main stem (P {\textgreater} 0.05), or betweenbasal diameter-biomass (allometric) equations for allcomponents (P {\textgreater} 0.1). The method was thentested by validating the biomass equations using anindependent data set from 35 white spruce seedlingsfrom the same site and cohort, but exposed todifferent treatments and microenvironmentalconditions. For each seedling, biomass components werepredicted using silhouette area-based and allometricequations, and a relative error of predictioncalculated. The mean relative error for silhouettearea-based predictions varied among biomass componentsfrom −20.25\% to −3.21\%, with standard deviation ofthe error ranging from 23.04\% to 33.44\%. The meanrelative error for allometric equations ranged from−2.46\% to −21.75\%, with standard deviations of23.34\% to 32.61\%. These results suggest that: (1)photo imagery can be used as an alternative to moretraditional allometric methods of biomass estimation,and (2) general (developed for a broad range ofgrowing conditions) equations derived by either methodare preferable to those specifically calibrated for agiven growing environment.},

The scan data was used to produce hemispheric views of the canopy at various locations that were compared to synchronously taken hemispherical photographs of the same part of the canopy. We conclude that terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in mature forests can overcome several of the methodological problems inherent to conventional canopy analysis with optical methods and thus may soon offer a promising tool for functional research in complex forest canopies. Certain limitations of the TLS approach, mostly caused by hardware limitations that will probably soon be overcome, are encountered.},

	abstract = {A typical method for finding the skeleton of a grayscale image is to threshold the image, then thin the result with one of several binary thinning algorithms. This process loses information in the intensity dimension by reducing all intensities to either one of two values. The loss of intensity information causes the skeleton of non-uniform grayscale images to be centrally located within the thresholded image, but may not lie along the maximum intensity ridge-line. In this paper we propose a method that avoids thresholding; instead we transform the grayscale image into a fuzzy set and use the degree of membership in the underlying object to find the skeleton along the maximum intensity ridge-line. Topographical labeling methods find a ridge-line by topographically labeling pixels; the ride-line is the union of peak, ridge and saddle-point pixels. These methods require preprocessing, or postprocessing, to find connected single pixel skeletons. We show the results of our algorithm on images varying in uniformity from a Gaussian-smoothed binary rectangle to a scanned image of a grayscale object. We compare results with the threshold-and-thin, and topographical labeling methods.},

A key element to accomplish this is the knowledge of the local variability in the sampled forest stand features. In this study, we estimated the variability of tree taxonomic richness and carbon (C) stock in logged-over and unlogged lowland tropical forests of Papua New Guinea, to define the optimal plot and sample size needed to estimate these characteristics in the context of the forthcoming implementation of the new NFI. We used data from 133 one-hectare permanent sample plots to calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) of C stock and taxonomic richness at different simulated plot sizes. CV was seen to rapidly decrease with increasing plot size up to 0.2–0.3 ha for both features following an inverse-exponential trend. Optimum plot size ranged between 0.08 and 0.32 ha, with 75–164 plots needed to achieve an estimation within 5 per cent of the true mean (95 per cent confidence), depending on the stand feature and the previous silvicultural treatment. We concluded that the establishment of a network of 319 permanent sample plots between 0.2 and 0.3 ha in size would represent an efficient sampling scheme in lowland forests for the new NFI.},

	abstract = {This book presents practical information about hemispherical photography from the perspectives of field data acquisition, image processing and information retrieval methods. This book is organized into three sections. The first section describes what is hemispherical photography and what are the fundamental elements of forest structure and light interactions within the forest canopy. The second section provides practical information about the equipment, procedures and tools for procuring, processing and analyzing hemispherical photographs. Armed with this information, the third section describes several applications of hemispherical photographs to forestry and natural resource assessment. The book concludes with a discussion about modelling tools and future directions of this rapidly growing field. There is currently no information source on the market that has this comprehensive range of topics combined in a single book. The book will appeal to academics, graduate students, natural resource professionals and researchers alike.},

	abstract = {Diameter distributions are an important source of information for estimating the timber assortment in forest stands. In this paper, a one-step procedure for deriving the parameters of a Weibull function, itself used to describe diameter distributions, is presented. A generalized linear model (GLM) is employed that allows for an estimation of the shape and scale parameters as functions of different predictors. The GLM was fit using 495 sample plots from a conventional sample-plot inventory. Plotwise height metrics derived from airborne laser scanner data serve as covariates (auxiliary variables). Each sample plot consists of four concentric circle plots, where the largest plot covers an area of 450 m2 (12 m radius). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) {\textless}30 cm are measured only on the smaller circle plots. Because of this design, left- and right-truncated Weibull distributions, conditional on the DBH, were used to fit the data. The frequently used two-step procedure — in which the Weibull distribution is firstly fitted via maximum likelihood, and its parameters are then estimated via linear regression — requires an adequate number of observations per sample plot in the first step. Hence, this method would have been unsuitable for the data source at hand, because a mean of just 12 trees per sample plot was recorded. The visual comparison of the predicted Weibull distributions with observed data shows a good fit to the data. The mean of the DBH distributions was estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.44 cm and a bias of 0.41 cm.},

	abstract = {Questions How does the spatial configuration of sampling units influence recorded plant species richness values at small spatial scales? What are the consequences of these findings for sampling methodology and rarefaction analyses? Location Six semi-natural grasslands in Western Eurasia (France, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Turkey). Methods In each site we established six blocks of 40 cm × 280 cm, subdivided into 5 cm × 5 cm micro-quadrats, on which we recorded vascular plant species presence with the rooted (all sites) and shoot (four sites) presence method. Data of these micro-quadrats were then combined to achieve larger sampling units of 0.01, 0.04 and 0.16 m² grain size with six different spatial configurations (square, 4:1 rectangle, 16:1 rectangle, three variants of discontiguous randomly placed micro-quadrats). The effect of the spatial configurations on species richness was quantified as relative richness compared to the mean richness of the square of the same surface area. Results Square sampling units had significantly lower species richness than other spatial configurations in all countries. For 4:1 and 16:1 rectangles, the increase of rooted richness was on average about 2\% and 8\%, respectively. In contrast, the average richness increase for discontiguous configurations was 7\%, 17\% and 40\%. In general, increases were higher with shoot presence than with rooted presence. Overall, the patterns of richness increase were highly consistent across six countries, three grain sizes and two recording methods. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the shape of sampling units has negligible effects on species richness values when the length–width ratio is up to 4:1, and the effects remain small even for more elongated contiguous configurations. In contrast, results from discontiguous sampling units are not directly comparable with those of contiguous sampling units, and are strongly confounded by spatial extent. This is particularly problematic for rarefaction studies where spatial extent is often not controlled for. We suggest that the concept of effective area is a useful tool to report effects of spatial configuration on richness values, and introduce species–extent relationships (SERs) to describe richness increases of different spatial configurations of sampling units.},

	abstract = {High quality data on plant species occurrence count among the essential data sources for ecological research and conservation purposes. Ecologically valuable small grain mosaics of heterogeneous shrub and herbaceous formations however pose a challenging environment for creating such species occurrence maps. Remote sensing can be useful for such purposes, it however faces several challenges, especially the need of ultra high spatial resolution (centimeters) data and distinguishing between plant species or genera. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of producing data with sufficient resolution; their use for identification of plant species is however still largely unexplored. A fusion of spectral data with LiDAR-derived vertical information can improve the classification accuracy, such a solution is however costly. A cheaper alternative of vertical data acquisition can be represented by the use of the structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM) utilizing the images taken for (multi/hyper)spectral analysis. We investigated the use of such a fusion of UAV-borne multispectral and SfM-derived vertical information acquired from a single sensor for classification of shrubland vegetation at species level and compared its accuracy with that derived from multispectral information only. Multispectral images were acquired using Tetracam Micro-MCA6 camera in the west of Czechia in a shrubland landscape protected within the NATURA 2000 network. Using (i) multispectral imagery only and (ii) multispectral-SfM fusion, we classified the vegetation into six classes representing four woody plant species and two meadow types. Our results prove that the multispectral-SfM fusion performs significantly better than multispectral only (88.2\% overall accuracy, 85.2\% mean producer’s accuracy and 85.7\% mean user’s accuracy for fusion instead of 73.3\%, 75.1\% and 63.7\%, respectively, for multispectral). We concluded that the fusion of multispectral and SfM information acquired from a single UAV sensor is a viable method for shrub species mapping.},

	abstract = {When using such methods as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), Bitterlich relascope and methods utilizing short-range terrestrial photogrammetry, one of the major factors influencing the accuracy of stand characteristics determination is the visibility of trees on a sample plot, which is often obscured by the shadow effect caused by trees located closer to the plot center. In the presented study the equation for assessing the visibility of the horizon in relationship to the sample plot radius and such characteristics of stands as stocking and quadratic mean diameter (QMD) was presented. The verification of the formulae using data from 30 sample plots with simple structure confirmed the practical applicability of the derived equation for the determination of horizon visibility on circular sample plots with radii above 15m. It has also been verified, that spatial arrangement of tress influences the derived relationship in the investigated stands with simple structures. The relationship between the horizon visibility and the accuracy of stocking and basal area has also been examined. It was concluded, that this relationship is relatively weak and significant only for close distances to the plot center. At the same time, the percentage of the visible trees and basal area also depends on the distance from the plot center. It has been concluded, that for the analyzed plots the error of stocking determination does not exceed 5\% for a plot radius up to 15m. The accuracy of tree identification is also particularly influenced by other trees located close to the plot center, which cause relatively large, significant obstacles in horizon visibility.},

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {Two common methods of measuring forest stand woody stem attributes include prism plots for basal area and modified point-distance for stem density. The data from each method can be used for the other calculation; that is, prism data can provide stem density, and point-distance data can provide estimated basal area. We examined data from the same 10 stands using the two techniques to determine whether the results for each calculation were comparable and/or consistent. There was a significant correlation between the estimated tree (defined as stems {\textgreater}10 cm) basal areas, and between tree stem densities, derived from the two methods (P {\textless} 0.01). Prism plots provided significantly higher estimated tree stem densities (+23.5\%; P {\textless} 0.05) compared to estimates from the point-distance technique, but there was no difference between estimated tree basal area. For all stems, that is also including stems {\textless}10 cm dbh, there was no difference between the two methods for estimated basal area or stem density. There was no correlation between total stem densities derived from the two methods. This is likely because the prism plot method (two-factor metric prism) sampled relatively few trees with small diameters, whereas the point distance technique, as used, sampled small trees independently from trees using a diameter distinction. When we removed two young stands with {\textless}50 trees/ha, there was no difference in estimates of stem density. We concluded that, for boreal forest stands with a normal density of trees (i.e., {\textgreater}10 cm dbh and 900 to 3,000 stems/ha), either method would provide comparable estimates of stem density and basal area. We found no time difference in conducting surveys using either method.},

	abstract = {Long-term ecological monitoring has contributed substantially towards advancements in theoretical and applied ecology. However, the costs to maintain a long-term monitoring site are enormous. Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) have been rapidly emerging as a new tool for local-scale monitoring. To evaluate the value of drone applications in long-term ecological studies, we combined drone-derived canopy variables, detailed ground-based stem-mapping data and topographic and edaphic variables from a 20-ha forest dynamics plot in a species-rich subtropical forest. Specifically, we evaluated the relative importance of these variables in explaining local-scale variation in forest stand and species measures. We found that drone-derived canopy variables contributed substantially towards explaining local patterns of biodiversity and more specifically in supporting a gap dynamics hypothesis in structuring observed forest biodiversity. Stand basal area was positively related with canopy closure, indicating the importance of protecting old-growth forests as carbon sinks. The importance of topographic and edaphic variables was also demonstrated, supporting a niche differentiation hypothesis in structuring patterns in biodiversity. Species-level analyses illustrated that light-demanding species were more strongly correlated with canopy variables than shade-tolerant species. We provide convincing evidence that drones can add substantial value to long-term ecological monitoring by providing low cost, high resolution data. Drones should be included in the ecologist's toolbox to complement traditional field surveys.},

There was excellent agreement for both the magnitude and timing in the annual variation in LAI from MC5 and biometric estimates at Howard Springs, near Darwin, whereas MC4 overestimated LAI by 1–2m2m−2 for the first 200 days of the year. Estimates of LAI from MC5 were also compared with those obtained from the analysis of digital hemispherical photographs taken during the dry season (September 2008) based on algorithms that included random and clumped distribution of leaves. Linear regression of LAI from MC5 versus that using the clumping algorithm yielded a slope close to 1 (m=0.98). The regression based on a random distribution of leaves yielded a slope significantly different from 1 (m=1.37), with higher Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and bias compared to the clumped analysis. The intercept for either analysis was not significantly different from zero but inclusion of five additional sites that were visually bare or without green vegetation produced a statistically significant offset of +0.16m2m−2 by MC5. Overall, our results show considerable improvement of MC5 over MC4 LAI and good agreement between MC5 and ground-based LAI estimates from hemispherical photos incorporating clumping of leaves.},

	abstract = {Reducing uncertainty of terrestrial carbon cycle depends strongly on the accurate estimation of changes of global forest carbon stock. However, this is a challenging problem from either ground surveys or remote sensing techniques in tropical forests. Here, we examine the feasibility of estimating changes of tropical forest biomass from two airborne lidar measurements of forest height acquired about 10 yr apart over Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We used the forest inventory data from the 50 ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot collected every 5 yr during the study period to calibrate the estimation. We compared two approaches for detecting changes in forest aboveground biomass (AGB): (1) relating changes in lidar height metrics from two sensors directly to changes in ground-estimated biomass; and (2) estimating biomass from each lidar sensor and then computing changes in biomass from the difference of two biomass estimates, using two models, namely one model based on five relative height metrics and the other based only on mean canopy height (MCH). We performed the analysis at different spatial scales from 0.04 ha to 10 ha. Method (1) had large uncertainty in directly detecting biomass changes at scales smaller than 10 ha, but provided detailed information about changes of forest structure. The magnitude of error associated with both the mean biomass stock and mean biomass change declined with increasing spatial scales. Method (2) was accurate at the 1 ha scale to estimate AGB stocks (R2 = 0.7 and RMSEmean = 27.6 Mg ha−1). However, to predict biomass changes, errors became comparable to ground estimates only at a spatial scale of about 10 ha or more. Biomass changes were in the same direction at the spatial scale of 1 ha in 60 to 64\% of the subplots, corresponding to p values of respectively 0.1 and 0.033. Large errors in estimating biomass changes from lidar data resulted from the uncertainty in detecting changes at 1 ha from ground census data, differences of approximately one year between the ground census and lidar measurements, and differences in sensor characteristics. Our results indicate that the 50 ha BCI plot lost a significant amount of biomass (−0.8 Mg ha−1 yr−1 ± 2.2(SD)) over the past decade (2000–2010). Over the entire island and during the same period, mean AGB change was 0.2 ± 2.4 Mg ha−1 yr−1 with old growth forests losing −0.7 Mg ha−1 yr−1 ± 2.2 (SD), and secondary forests gaining +1.8 Mg ha yr−1 ± 3.4 (SD) biomass. Our analysis suggests that repeated lidar surveys, despite taking measurement with different sensors, can estimate biomass changes in old-growth tropical forests at landscape scales ({\textgreater}10 ha).},

We used two different UAV and camera systems, and found that both systems provided statistically similar results to the conventional measurements of LAD on five common broadleaf tree species of Europe and North America. In addition to overcoming challenges of UAV airspace regulation and piloting UAVs within complex forest canopies, we recommend potential users of this method should identify, minimize, and correct for any image distortion effects created by their UAV and camera system. With these considerations in mind, our results indicate that UAVs can be used to measure LAD in virtually any broadleaf forest environment, which opens the new possibility for obtaining accurate, species-specific information on the variability of LAD through time and along broad environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing-based methods of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in forest ecosystems have gained increased attention, and substantial research has been conducted in the past three decades. This paper provides a survey of current biomass estimation methods using remote sensing data and discusses four critical issues – collection of field-based biomass reference data, extraction and selection of suitable variables from remote sensing data, identification of proper algorithms to develop biomass estimation models, and uncertainty analysis to refine the estimation procedure. Additionally, we discuss the impacts of scales on biomass estimation performance and describe a general biomass estimation procedure. Although optical sensor and radar data have been primary sources for AGB estimation, data saturation is an important factor resulting in estimation uncertainty. LIght Detection and Ranging (lidar) can remove data saturation, but limited availability of lidar data prevents its extensive application. This literature survey has indicated the limitations of using single-sensor data for biomass estimation and the importance of integrating multi-sensor/scale remote sensing data to produce accurate estimates over large areas. More research is needed to extract a vertical vegetation structure (e.g. canopy height) from interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) or optical stereo images to incorporate it into horizontal structures (e.g. canopy cover) in biomass estimation modeling.},

Results show that during DOY (day of year) 202–237 (at flourish stage), the estimated LAI by logarithmic ellipse method and PAI by LAI 2000-4 rings method were 1.96 and 1.95m2m−2, respectively, which were close to the direct LAI (1.85m2m−2). However, the direct LAI was higher than the estimated LAI from ellipse method of Hemiview (1.59m2m−2) and lower than the estimated PAI from gap fraction analysis method of Photoshop (2.67m2m−2). Thus the methods of logarithmic ellipse and the LAI 2000-4 rings were used to estimate the LAI (PAI) from hemispherical images. And the estimated LAI by the methods of logarithmic ellipse and the LAI 2000-4 rings were used to analyze seasonal variations of canopy parameters. LAI increased rapidly at leaf expanding stage and then maintained at high level from the vigorous to harvest stage. Canopy gap fraction in the south side was similar to that in the north side. The leaf inclination angle tended horizontally to receive more radiation with the development of apple growth. In addition, the estimated LAI from hemispherical images using the methods of logarithmic ellipse and LAI 2000-4 rings was accurate even without calibrating clumping index. Thus the estimated canopy parameters from hemispherical images using the methods of logarithmic ellipse and LAI 2000-4 rings can be used for the modeling of evapotranspiration.},

It is of great significance to estimate AGB and LAI accurately using remote sensing technology. Considering the temporal resolution and data acquisition costs, digital aerial photographs (DAPs) from a digital camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle or light, small aircraft have been widely used in forest inventory. In this study, the aerial photograph data was acquired on 5 and 9 June, 2017 by a Hasselblad60 digital camera of the CAF-LiCHy system in a Y-5 aircraft in the Mengjiagang forest farm of Northeast China, and the digital orthophoto mosaic (DOM) and photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) were generated from an aerial overlap photograph. Forest red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices and textural factors were extracted from the DOM. Forest vertical structure features and canopy cover were extracted from normalized PPC. Regression analysis was carried out considering only DOM data, only PPC data, and a combination of both. A recursive feature elimination (RFE) method using a random forest was used for variable selection. Four different machine-learning (ML) algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, Cubist and supporting vector machine) were used to build regression models. Experimental results showed that PPC data alone could estimate AGB, and DOM data alone could estimate LAI with relatively high accuracy. The combination of features from DOM and PPC data was the most effective, in all the experiments considered, for the estimation of AGB and LAI. The results showed that the height and coverage variables of PPC, texture mean value, and the visible differential vegetation index (VDVI) of the DOM are significantly related to the estimated AGB (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 20 t/ha). The results also showed that the canopy cover of PPC and green red ratio index (GRRI) of DOM are the most strongly related to the estimated LAI, and the height and coverage variables of PPC, the texture mean value and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), and the VDVI of DOM followed (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.48).},

To understand the contribution of understory carbon to the United States (US) carbon budget, we developed an approach that relies on field measurements of understory vegetation cover and height on US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subplots. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground understory carbon. A spatial model based on stand characteristics and remotely sensed data was also applied to estimate understory carbon on all FIA plots. We found that most understory carbon was comprised of woody shrub species (64\%), followed by nonwoody forbs and graminoid species (35\%) and seedlings (1\%). The largest estimates were found in temperate or warm humid locations such as the Pacific Northwest and southeastern US, thus following the same broad trend as aboveground tree biomass. The average understory aboveground carbon density was estimated to be 0.977 Mg ha −1 , for a total estimate of 272 Tg carbon across all managed forest land in the US (approximately 2\% of the total aboveground live tree carbon pool). This estimate is more than twice as low as previous FIA modeled estimates that did not rely on understory measurements, suggesting that this pool may currently be overestimated in US National Greenhouse Gas reporting.},

In this paper, we propose a robust method to extract vegetation from the plant images taken under natural light conditions using wheat images. The method is based on a machine learning process, decision tree and image noise reduction filters. We adopted the CART algorithm to create a decision tree in the training process and examined its performance using test images, comparing it with the performances of other methods such as ExG, ExG-ExR and Modified ExG which are widely used recently. The results showed that the accuracy of the vegetation extraction by the proposed method was significantly better than that of the other methods particularly for the images which include strongly shadowed and specularly reflected parts. The proposed method also has an advantage that the same model can be applied to different images without requiring a threshold adjustment for each image.},

Alternative estimators include form-class methods, importance sampling, the centroid method, and multi-point profile (taper) estimation systems; all of these require some measurement or estimate of upper stem diameters. The multi-point profile system discussed here allows for upper stem measurements at any heights and constructs a smooth profile prediction that passes through all measurement points. Results from a cruise sample of trees can be summarized to allow for improved profile predictions for the non-sampled trees, which lack upper stem measurements. Decisions must be made on which measurement heights to use, which trees to sample, and how to make the upper stem measurements. The driving forces in sample efficiency are measurement error, between-tree and between-stand variation in form, and within-tree correlations at differing heights. Results from several sources are brought together to illustrate the magnitude of the variances; the focus here is on how to reduce the between-stand errors associated with taper and bark thickness. Suggestions are offered for efficient use of three-point profile systems, addressing measurement techniques, sampling methods, and summarization procedures.},

	abstract = {Allometric relations for tree growth modelling have been subject to research for decades, partly as empirical models, and partly as process models such as the pipe model, hydraulic architecture, mechanical approaches or the fractal-like nature of plant architecture. Unlike empirical studies, process models aim at explaining the scaling within tree architecture as a function of biological, physical or mechanical factors and at modelling their effect on functionality and growth of different parts of an individual tree. The goal of the underlying study is to link theoretical explanation to empirical approaches of tree biomass estimation by the example of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). Decisively, this article tries to take allometry out of the purely curve-fitting exercise common in literature and derives implications for the use of allometric biomass functions.

Our results demonstrate that the dbh as independent variable might be misleading for the comparison of universal scaling laws with empirical studies. We were able to show, that the use of a recalculated diameter in relative stem height by means of a taper form model confirms general biological implications better than the dbh measured at a fixed tree height. We used a compiled dataset of altogether 245 trees that were measured on different sites in central Europe to proof our consideration. As one result we estimated a scaling factor b of 2.65 for the allometric relation (agb = a  View the MathML sourceD0.1b) between a diameter in relative stem height (D0.1) and aboveground biomass (agb), which is close to scaling relations predicted by process models. The standard error of a linear regression model based on the log-transformed variables could be slightly reduced to 0.21 (R2 = 0.98) when we used the diameter in relative tree height.},

The model predicting DBH from crown radius fit the data poorly (R2 = 0.2876), but improvements were made when the model fit by forest life zone and crown radius measurement protocol. Models fit with both maximum crown radius and tree height and R-square values that ranged from 0.1803 for the subtropical dry forest to 0.8018 for the subtropical moist forest life zone where crown radius was measured with urban forest inventory protocols. Tree heights had stronger correlations with DBH than did crown radius, perhaps due to difficulties in measuring tree crown width or natural variability in this hurricane-disturbed environment. Models that use tree height have some potential for predicting DBH for use in Caribbean forest biomass and carbon estimation models, but the potential for error propagation by using DBH predicted from crown radius is too great to earn our recommendation for such applications.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009EGUGA..1112447J},
	abstract = {Digital hemispherical canopy photography (DHP) is a close-range remote 
sensing technique for quantitatively studying plant canopies via
photographs acquired through a hemispherical (fisheye) lens. The digital
technique has become quite popular the last decades for in situ biomass
and light regime estimation in agricultural and forest ecosystems with a
lot of studies in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, but is
relatively unexplored in tropical forest ecosystems' applications.
Therefore, this study focuses on the potential of biomass and light
regime estimation using hemispherical photography in a tropical forest.
The field study is the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot, a tropical
forest in the Luquillo mountains of north eastern Puerto Rico. The plot
encompasses areas of differing intensities of past human disturbance and
in addition the region has been hit by two major hurricanes since 1989.
Analyses of this forest plot are used to assess shifts in the relative
importance of land-use history, biotic and abiotic variables, as the
forest recovers from hurricane damage. A time series of hemispherical
images has been acquired on a biannual basis over 10 years (1997-2007)
using a systematic grid sampling strategy in the forest. These results
will be used to predict forest regrowth and will have implications for
forests throughout the tropics that will likely experience increases in
hurricane disturbance and human impacts in the coming decades.  In this
study, the time-series dataset has been analyzed using different
commonly used automatic thresholding and LAI inversion algorithms, in
order to test the algorithms' performance and capability for biomass and
light regime (change) estimation. The study has as main goal to detect
potentials and limits in use for typical tropical forest regimes.
Overall, the hemispherical photography technique has shown to be a
possible reliable tool for in situ biomass and light regime estimation
in tropical forest ecosystems, but caution should be held. The limits of
the algorithms are discussed and the results corroborate the hypothesis
that the biomass and light regime estimates become less reliable in case
of high LAI values.},

	abstract = {Leaf-cover area is a widely required plant development parameter for predictive models of weed growth and competition. Its assessment is performed either manually, which is labor intensive, or via visual inspection, which provides biased results. In contrast, digital image processing enables a high level of automation, thereby offering an attractive means for estimating vegetative leaf-cover area. Nonetheless, image-driven analysis is greatly affected by illumination conditions and camera position at the time of imaging and therefore may introduce bias into the analysis. Addressing both of these factors, this paper proposes an image-based model for leaf-cover area and biomass measurements. The proposed model transforms color images into an illumination-invariant representation, thus facilitating accurate leaf-cover detection under varying light conditions. To eliminate the need for fixed camera position, images are transformed into an object–space reference frame, enabling measurement in absolute metric units. Application of the proposed model shows stability in leaf-cover detection and measurement irrespective of camera position and external illumination conditions. When tested on purple nutsedge, one of the world's most troublesome weeds, a linear relation between measured leaf-cover area and plant biomass was obtained regardless of plant developmental stage. Data on the expansion of purple nutsedge leaf-cover area is essential for modeling its spatial growth. The proposed model offers the possibility of acquiring reliable and accurate biological data from digital images without extensive photogrammetric or image-processing expertise.

	abstract = {This article proposes a simple new logic for classifying global vegetation. The critical features of this classification are that 1) it is based on simple, observable, unambiguous characteristics of vegetation structure that are important to ecosystem biogeochemistry and can be measured in the field for validation, 2) the structural characteristics are remotely sensible so that repeatable and efficient global reclassifications of existing vegetation will be possible, and 3) the defined vegetation classes directly translate into the biophysical parameters of interest by global climate and biogeochemical models. A first test of this logic for the continental United States is presented based on an existing 1 km AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index database. Procedures for solving critical remote sensing problems needed to implement the classification are discussed. Also, some inferences from this classification to advanced vegetation biophysical variables such as specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity useful to global biogeochemical modeling are suggested.},

Approximately half the data were used to estimate model parameters with the rest used for model evaluation. Multiple Chapman–Richards functions with parameters expressed in terms of various stand characteristics were fit to determine the best models for predicting height.

Models providing the most accurate prediction of height included basal area, trees/ha, dominant stand height, and diameter at breast height (DBH). A mixed-effects modeling approach was applied in fitting the models for all tree species. Heights predicted by models including random-effects parameters (calibrated response) were compared with those developed without random-effects parameters (fixed-effects response). Including the random parameter consistently resulted in a better fit to the data (smaller AIC values) and an improved prediction accuracy.},

However, no attempt has been made so far to develop non-destructive approaches to LAI estimation for aquatic vegetation. Using the submerged plant species Potamogeton malainus, the objective of this study was to determine whether the gap fraction derived from vertical photographs could be used to estimate LAI of aquatic vegetation. Our results suggested that upward-oriented photographs taken from beneath the water surface were more suitable for distinguishing vegetation from other objects than were downward-oriented photographs taken from above the water surface. Exposure settings had a substantial influence on the identification of vegetation in upward-oriented photographs. Automatic exposure performed nearly as well as the optimal trial exposure, making it a good choice for operational convenience. Similar to terrestrial vegetation, our results suggested that photographs taken for the purpose of distinguishing gap fraction in aquatic vegetation should be taken under diffuse light conditions. Significant logarithmic relationships were observed between the vertical gap fraction derived from upward-oriented photographs and plant area index (PAI) and LAI derived from destructive harvesting. The model we developed to depict the relationship between PAI and gap fraction was similar to the modified theoretical Poisson model, with coefficients of 1.82 and 1.90 for our model and the theoretical model, respectively. This suggests that vertical upward-oriented photographs taken from below the water surface are a feasible alternative to destructive harvesting for estimating PAI and LAI for the submerged aquatic plant Potamogeton malainus.},

Here, we show theoretically and empirically that the leaf area index of vegetation with large gaps can be measured by suitably averaging the local gap frequency, as detected by the transmission of the direct beam of the sun. The recommended procedure is to average the transmission linearly over a horizontal path ten times the characteristic width of a leaf and take the logarithm of this mean. The average of logarithms for many such paths is shown to be linearly related to the leaf area index. The estimate of leaf area index obtained by this procedure is more accurate than that obtained by averaging the transmission once over the full path. The analysis has been confirmed with measurements of crops of sorghum and wheat. The method is simple and appears most appropriate for forests.},

An estimation of shrub biomass using allometric equations represents a non-destructive option for obtaining useful quantitative data. However, species-specific allometric equations for alpine shrubs have yet to be developed in sufficient detail. This study proposed allometric equations that can be used to estimate aboveground biomass of alpine shrubs. These are based on easily acquired descriptive parameters of plant height (H), crown area (C), basal diameter (D), and D 2 H (basal diameter squared × total H) for four of the most abundant alpine shrub species in the upstream ecosystems of China’s Heihe River Basin: Salix cupularis, Salix oritrepha, Potentilla fruticosa, and Caragana jubata. The results show that several equations relating biomass categories to H, C, and D 2 H provided significant (P {\textless} 0.01) data for measuring aboveground biomass; the determination coefficients (R 2) varied from 0.95 to 0.97 and fit indices (FIs) varied from 0.96 to 0.97. The form and variables comprising the allometric equations differed among species-specific models. Aboveground shrub biomass increased with D 2 H for S. cupularis and C. jubata, whereas it increased with C and H for P. fruticosa. For S. oritrepha, an exponential function provided the best-fit model with C. However, the results could provide useful approximations of aboveground biomass of similar shrubs currently lacking such equations. The allometric equations also provide a useful and non-destructive method of estimating aboveground shrub biomass in alpine ecosystems.},

Researchers often employ visual methods to estimate ground cover, but these approaches may be prone to observer bias. We therefore evaluated a method using digital photographs of vegetation to objectively quantify percent ground cover of grasses, forbs, shrubs, litter, and bare ground within 90 plots of 2m2. We carried out object-based image analysis, using a software program called eCognition, to divide photographs into different vegetation classes (based on similarities among neighboring pixels) to estimate percent ground cover for each category. We used the Kappa index of agreement (KIA) to quantify correctly classified, randomly selected segments of all images. Our KIA values indicated strong agreement ({\textgreater} 80\%) of all vegetation categories, with an average of 90–96\% (SE = 5\%) of shrub, litter, forb, and grass segments classified correctly. We also created artificial plots with known percentages of each vegetation category to evaluate the accuracy of software predictions. Observed differences between true cover and eCognition estimates for each category ranged from 1 to 4\%. This technique provides a repeatable and reliable way to estimate percent ground cover that allows quantification of classification accuracy.},

Here we suggest the usage of tests of equivalence, which use the hypothesis of dissimilarity as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is unacceptable. Thus, they flip the burden of proof back onto the model. We demonstrate the application of equivalence testing to model validation using an empirical forest growth model and an extensive database of field measurements.

the tree level, field measurements were intensive and thus material
consisted of only 20 trees located at 11 stands. Stem and crown
diameters were extracted manually from TLS point clouds and used as
predictors for total biomass. Correlations from 0.96 to 0.99 between
predicted and field measured biomass estimates were obtained.
Examination of stem form predictions showed that various diameters
measured by TLS could enhance the tree level stem curve predictions.
Results are rather promising, but more field data is needed for
developing practical modelling means. Our further studies will
concentrate on automation of TLS data processing and use the of TLS

Specifically, compared to the traditional works on forest growth inventory with airborne laser scanning, two issues are regarded: “Can the new technique characterize the height growth for each individual tree?” and “Can this technique refine the minimum growth-discernable temporal interval further?” To solve these two puzzles, the sampling principles of the three laser scanning modes were first examined, and their error sources against the task of tree-top capturing were also analyzed. Next, the three-year growths of 58 Nordic maple trees (Crimson King) for test were intermittently surveyed with one type of laser scanning each time and then analyzed by statistics. The evaluations show that the height growth of each individual tree still cannot be reliably characterized even by single-scan terrestrial laser scanning, and statistical analysis is necessary in this scenario. After Gaussian regression, it is found that the minimum temporal interval with distinguishable tree height growths can be refined into one month based on terrestrial laser scanning, far better than the two years deduced in the previous works based on airborne laser scanning. The associated mean growth was detected to be about 0.12 m. Moreover, the parameter of tree height generally under-estimated by airborne and even mobile laser scanning can be relatively revised by means of introducing static terrestrial laser scanning data. Overall, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is primarily validated.},

Directional gap fraction distributions were determined from digital hemispherical photographs recorded at the same sampling locations in the forest, and these data were compared with distributions computed from the laser scanner data. The results showed that the measured directional gap fraction distributions were similar for both hemispherical photography and TLS data with a high degree of precision in the area of overlap of orthogonal laser scans.

Between treatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (a = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutting cycle resulted in increased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the primary goal were production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

Most people apply the latter approach, which uses the tangents of the angles to the top and bottom and a true horizontal distance to the subject tree. However, few adjust this method for ground slope, tree lean, crown shape, and crown configuration, making errors commonplace. Given documented discrepancies exceeding 30\% with current methods, a reevaluation of height measurement is in order. The sine method is an alternative that measures a real point in the crown. Hence, it is not subject to the same assumptions as the similar triangle and tangent approaches. In addition, the sine method is insensitive to distance from tree or observer position and can not overestimate tree height. The advantages of the sine approach are shown with mature southern pines from Arkansas.},

The camera can be pointed to any direction, and the large field of view reduces the number of photographs. This paper aims to show that accurate metric reconstructions can be achieved with affordable sensors (less than 300 euro). The camera used in this work is the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere 360, which has a cost of about 300 USD (January 2018). Experiments demonstrate that millimeter-level accuracy can be obtained during the image orientation and surface reconstruction steps, in which the solution from 360\&deg; images was compared to check points measured with a total station and laser scanning point clouds. The paper will summarize some practical rules for image acquisition as well as the importance of ground control points to remove possible deformations of the network during bundle adjustment, especially for long sequences with unfavorable geometry. The generation of orthophotos from images having a 360\&deg; field of view (that captures the entire scene around the camera) is discussed. Finally, the paper illustrates some case studies where the use of a 360\&deg; camera could be a better choice than a project based on central perspective cameras. Basically, 360\&deg; cameras become very useful in the survey of long and narrow spaces, as well as interior areas like small rooms.},

	abstract = {Spatial measures of forest biomass are important to implement sustainable forest management, monitor global change, and model forest productivity. Several methods for estimating forest biomass by remote sensing have been developed, but their comparative advantages have not been evaluated for large areas in Canada. This study compares four methods to map forest biomass on an extended pilot region (20,000km2) located in western Newfoundland. The methods include: (i) Direct Radiometric Relationships (DRR), (ii) k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), (iii) Land Cover Classification (LCC), and (iv) Biomass from Cluster Labeling Using Structure and Type (BioCLUST). The results of each method were evaluated using an independent set of ground survey plots and compared with a baseline biomass map generated from biomass tables applied to forest inventory stand maps. Considering the root mean square error (RMSE) assessed with the inventory plots, the DRR, k-NN, and BioCLUST methods provided similar results, with average RMSE values of 59, 59, and 58t/ha, respectively. Bias values were lowest for the k-NN method followed by DRR, BioCLUST, and LCC (6, −8, 17, and 42t/ha, respectively). Assessed with the baseline map, the BioCLUST method produced the lowest RMSE (41t/ha) and bias (−4t/ha) followed by the DRR and k-NN methods, with RMSE values of 47 and 54t/ha and bias values of 9 and 23t/ha, respectively. The method using biomass tables applied on the classified TM image (LCC) provided the greatest RMSE and bias, but may be suitable for applications that do not require a high level of precision. The BioCLUST and LCC methods provided practical advantages for the type of data sets available. Overall, the choice of a method rests on both the availability of data sets and the level of precision of the results required.},

These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic.

	abstract = {The estimation of aboveground biomass density (organic dry mass per unit area) is required for balancing Canadian national forest carbon budgets. Tree biomass equations are the basic tool for converting inventory plot data into biomass density. New sets of national tree biomass equations have therefore been produced from archival biomass data collected at the beginning of the 1980s through the ENergy from the FORest research program (ENFOR) of the Canadian Forest Service. Since the sampling plan was not standardized among provinces and territories, data had to be harmonized before any biomass equation could be considered at the national level. Two features characterize the new equations: estimated biomass of the compartments (foliage, branch, wood, and bark) are constrained to equal the total biomass, and dependence among error terms for the considered compartments of the same tree is taken into account in the estimates of both the model parameters and the variance prediction. The estimation method known to economists as seemingly unrelated regression allowed the inclusion of dependencies among the error terms of the considered biomass compartments. Sets of equations based on diameter at breast height (dbh) and on dbh and height have been produced for 33 species, groups of hardwood and softwood, and for all species combined. Biomass predicted by the new equations was compared with that estimated from provincial equations to evaluate the loss of accuracy when scaling up from the regional to the national scale. Bias and error of prediction from the set of national equations based on dbh and height were generally more similar to those from provincial equations than to those of predictions from the set of equations based on dbh alone.},

	abstract = {This research deals with an efficient and low cost methodology to obtain a metric and photorealstic survey of a complex architecture. Photomodeling is an already tested interactive approach to produce a detailed and quick 3D model reconstruction. Photomodeling goes along with the creation of a rough surface over which oriented images can be back-projected in real time. Lastly the model can be enhanced checking the coincidence between the surface and the projected texture. The challenge of this research is to combine the advantages of two technologies already set up and used in many projects: spherical photogrammetry (Fangi, 2007,2008,2009,2010) and structure for motion (Photosynth web service and Bundler + CMVS2 + PMVS2). The input images are taken from the same points of view to form the set of panoramic photos paying attention to use well-suited projections: equirectangular for spherical photogrammetry and rectilinear for Photosynth web service. The performance of the spherical photogrammetry is already known in terms of its metric accuracy and acquisition quickness but time is required in the restitution step because of the manual homologous point recognition from different panoramas. In Photosynth instead the restitution is quick and automated: the provided point clouds are useful benchmarks to start with the model reconstruction even if lacking in details and scale. The proposed workflow needs of ad-hoc tools to capture high resolution rectilinear panoramic images and visualize Photosynth point clouds and orientation camera parameters. All of them are developed in VVVV programming environment. 3DStudio Max environment is then chosen because of its performance in terms of interactive modeling, UV mapping parameters handling and real time visualization of projected texture on the model surface. Experimental results show how is possible to obtain a 3D photorealistic model using the scale of the spherical photogrammetry restitution to orient web provided point clouds. Moreover the proposed research highlights how is possible to speed up the model reconstruction without losing metric and photometric accuracy. In the same time, using the same panorama dataset, it picks out a useful chance to compare the orientations coming from the two mentioned technologies (Spherical Photogrammetry and Structure for Motion).},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is the environmental variable synthesizing the effect of climate, soil, and vegetation on the dynamics of water-limited ecosystems. Unlike abiotic factors (e.g., soil texture and rainfall regime), the control exerted by vegetation composition and structure on soil moisture variability remains poorly understood. A number of field studies in dryland landscapes have found higher soil water contents in vegetated soil patches than in adjacent bare soil, providing a convincing explanation for the observed preferential establishment of grasses and seedlings beneath tree canopies. Thus, because water is the limiting factor for vegetation in arid and semiarid ecosystems, a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture and woody vegetation dynamics. It is still unclear how the strength of such a feedback would change under different long-term rainfall regimes. To this end, we report some field observations from savanna ecosystems located along the south-north rainfall gradient in the Kalahari, where the presence of relatively uniform sandy soils limits the effects of covarying factors. The data available from our field study suggest that the contrast between the soil moisture in the canopy and intercanopy space increases (with wetter soils under the canopy) with increasing levels of aridity. We hypothesize that this contrast may lead to a positive feedback and explore the implications of such a feedback in a minimalistic model. We found that when the feedback is relatively strong, the system may exhibit two stable states corresponding to conditions with and without tree canopy cover. In this case, even small changes in environmental variables may lead to rapid and largely irreversible shifts to a state with no tree canopy cover. Our data suggest that the tendency of the system to exhibit two (alternative) stable states becomes stronger in the more arid regions. Thus, at the desert margins, vegetation is more likely to be prone to discontinuous and abrupt state changes.},

	abstract = {Covering 40\% of the terrestrial surface, dryland ecosystems characteristically have distinct vegetation structures that are strongly linked to their function. Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass–to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine ({\textless}1cm2) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm3 in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r2 from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.},

However, direct measures of LAI are destructive and tedious so that samplings can seldom be repeated in time and in space. Green canopy cover (GCC) is directly involved in crop growth and development. GCC estimation can benefit from aerial observation, as it can be measured by using image analysis or estimated by obtaining different vegetation indices. The main purpose of the second part of this paper was to study the relationships between GCC and LAI by using aerial images from UAVs in order to characterize crop growth. Also, the relationships between GCC and a vegetation index based on the visible spectrum was calibrated and validated. Relationships between LAI and GCC, growing degree days (GDD) and GCC and GDD and LAI were calibrated and validated for maize and onion crops with proper fitting. Visible atmospherically resistant index also appears to be a sensitive indicator to different growing stages and could generally be applied to any field crop. To apply this methodology, GCC and LAI relationships must be calibrated for many other crops in different irrigable areas. In addition, the cost of the UAV is expected to decrease while autonomy increases through improved battery life and reductions in the weight of on-board sensors.},

To date, heavy reliance has been placed on obtaining such data from remote-sensing instruments mounted on spacecraft or manned aircraft, although the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data are often not suited to local-scale ecological investigations. Recent technological innovations have led to an upsurge in the availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) — aircraft remotely operated from the ground — and there are now many lightweight UAVs on offer at reasonable costs. Flying low and slow, UAVs offer ecologists new opportunities for scale-appropriate measurements of ecological phenomena. Equipped with capable sensors, UAVs can deliver fine spatial resolution data at temporal resolutions defined by the end user. Recent innovations in UAV platform design have been accompanied by improvements in navigation and the miniaturization of measurement technologies, allowing the study of individual organisms and their spatiotemporal dynamics at close range.},

	abstract = {1. Structural diversity and niche differences within habitats are important for stabilizing species coexistence. However, land-use change leading to environmental homogenization is a major cause for the dramatic decline of biodiversity under global change. The difficulty in assessing large-scale biodiversity losses urgently requires new technological advances to evaluate land-use impact on diversity timely and efficiently across space. 2. While cost-effective aerial images have been suggested for potential biodiversity assessments in forests, correlation of canopy object variables such as gaps with plant or animal diversity has so far not been demonstrated using these images. 3. Here, we show that aerial images of canopy gaps can be used to assess floristic biodiversity of the forest understorey. This approach is made possible because we employed cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles and very high-resolution images (7 cm pixel−1) of the canopy properties. We demonstrate that detailed, spatially implicit information on gap shape metrics is sufficient to reveal strong dependency between disturbance patterns and plant diversity (R2 up to 0·74). This is feasible because opposing disturbance patterns such as aggregated and dispersed tree retention directly correspond to different functional and dispersal traits of species and ultimately to different species diversities. 4. Our findings can be used as a coarse-filter approach to conservation in forests wherever light strongly limits regeneration and biodiversity.},

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image-processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high-resolution data. Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.},

However, DEM-derived variables are scale-dependent and, given the increasing availability of very high-resolution (VHR) DEMs, their ecological relevance must be assessed for different spatial resolutions. In a study area located in the Swiss Western Alps, we computed VHR DEMs-derived variables related to morphometry, hydrology and solar radiation. Based on an original spatial resolution of 0·5 m, we generated DEM-derived variables at 1, 2 and 4 m spatial resolutions, applying a Gaussian Pyramid. Their associations with local climatic factors, measured by sensors (direct and ambient air temperature, air humidity and soil moisture) as well as ecological indicators derived from species composition, were assessed with multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) and mixed models (GLMM). Specific VHR DEM-derived variables showed significant associations with climatic factors. In addition to slope, aspect and curvature, the underused wetness and ruggedness indices modelled measured ambient humidity and soil moisture, respectively. Remarkably, spatial resolution of VHR DEM-derived variables had a significant influence on models’ strength, with coefficients of determination decreasing with coarser resolutions or showing a local optimum with a 2 m resolution, depending on the variable considered. These results support the relevance of using multi-scale DEM variables to provide surrogates for important climatic variables such as humidity, moisture and temperature, offering suitable alternatives to direct measurements for evolutionary ecology studies at a local scale.},

Remote-sensing techniques, such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and image-based point clouds, are potentially revolutionary techniques for measuring vegetation biomass and deriving other related, structural metrics for these purposes. Surface vegetation biomass (up to 25 cm) in pasture, forest, and woodland environments is estimated from a 3D point cloud derived from a small number of digital images. Volume is calculated, using the 3D cloud and regressed against dry weight to provide an estimate of biomass. Assessment of the method is made through comparison to 3D point clouds collected through TLS surveys. High correlation between destructively sampled biomass and vegetation volume derived from TLS and image-based point clouds in the pasture (TLS , image based ), dry grassy forest (TLS , image based ) and lowland forest (TLS , image based ) environments was found. Occlusion caused by standing vegetation in the woodland environment resulted in moderate correlation between TLS derived volume and biomass (). The effects of surrounding vegetation on the image-based technique resulted in 3D point clouds being resolved for only 40\% of the samples in this environment. The results of this study demonstrate that image-based point cloud techniques are highly viable for the measurement of surface biomass. In contrast to TLS, volume and biomass data can be captured using low-cost equipment and relatively little expertise.},

Seasonal change in a camera-based index (rG: ratio of green channel) reflected the characteristic events of the foliage phenology such as the leaf-flush and leaf senescence. In addition, the seasonal pattern of the rG was similar to that of the aboveground green biomass throughout the year. Moreover, there was a positive linear relationship between rG and aboveground green biomass (R2=0.81, p{\textless}0.05), as was the case with spectra-based vegetation indices. On the basis of these results, we conclude that continuous observation using digital cameras is a useful tool that is less labor intensive than conventional methods for estimating aboveground green biomass and monitoring foliage phenology in short-grass grasslands in Japan.},

	abstract = {Among many indirect approaches to retrieve effective leaf area index (LAI), hemispherical photography is now widely used by the scientific community in forestry applications. A recent software (CAN\_EYE) is used to estimate effective and true LAI from unidirectional gap fractions measured in crops. The effective LAI is computed with the Poisson law whereas the true LAI is estimated introducing a clumping index in the Poisson law. The clumping index estimation is based on the Lang and Xiang averaging method. CAN\_EYE includes an automatic image classification and allows the processing of series of photographs which is mandatory to sample the spatial variability of the canopy. The objective of this study is to determine if the use of the clumping index in the gap fraction formulation improves seasonal LAI estimates of crops. Hemispherical photographs were taken throughout two growing seasons over wheat, sunflower and maize canopies. CAN\_EYE LAI estimates were then compared to destructive LAI. The conditions under which photographs were acquired and processed are discussed. For the three crops studied here, the minimum distance required between camera and canopy is 1m. When feasible, there is a clear advantage in acquiring the images from above canopies and on overcast days to facilitate the image classification. For wheat and sunflower, the best LAI estimates are assessed with effective LAI (RMSE of 0.15, y=0.9540x for wheat and RMSE of 0.38, y=0.8427x for sunflower). For maize, the best LAI estimates are obtained using the clumping index (RMSE of 0.39 and y=0.9010x). Despite good fits between CAN\_EYE and destructive LAI estimates, compensation effects between leaf area index and leaf angle distribution may occur during the inversion procedure. Moreover, values of clumping index given by CAN\_EYE are in certain cases correlated with the size of the cells used to divide photographs. The Lang and Xiang averaging method introduced into CAN-EYE should be improved.},

Either optical sensor data or radar data are more suitable for forest sites with relatively simple forest stand structure than the sites with complex biophysical environments. A combination of spectral responses and image textures improves biomass estimation performance. More research is needed to focus on the integration of optical and radar data, the use of multi‐source data, and the selection of suitable variables and algorithms for biomass estimation at different scales.

	abstract = {Canopies are complex multilayered structures comprising individual plant crowns exposing a multifaceted surface area to sunlight. Foliage arrangement and properties are the main mediators of canopy functions. The leaves act as light traps whose exposure to sunlight varies with time of the day, date and latitude in a trade-off between photosynthetic light harvesting and excessive or photoinhibitory light avoidance. To date, ecological research based upon leaf sampling has been limited by the available technology, with which data acquisition becomes labour intensive and time-consuming, given the overwhelming number of leaves involved. In the present study, our goal involved developing a tool capable of measuring a sufficient number of leaves to enable analysis of leaf populations, tree crowns and canopies. We specifically tested whether a cell phone working as a 3D pointer could yield reliable, repeatable and valid leaf angle measurements with a simple gesture. We evaluated the accuracy of this method under controlled conditions, using a 3D digitizer, and we compared performance in the field with the methods commonly used. We presented an equation to estimate the potential proportion of the leaf exposed to direct sunlight (SAL) at any given time and compared the results with those obtained by means of a graphical method. We found a strong and highly significant correlation between the graphical methods and the equation presented. The calibration process showed a strong correlation between the results derived from the two methods with a mean relative difference below 10\%. The mean relative difference in calculation of instantaneous exposure was below 5\%. Our device performed equally well in diverse locations, in which we characterized over 700 leaves in a single day. The new method, involving the use of a cell phone, is much more effective than the traditional methods or digitizers when the goal is to scale up from leaf position to performance of leaf populations, tree crowns or canopies. Our methodology constitutes an affordable and valuable tool within which to frame a wide range of ecological hypotheses and to support canopy modelling approaches.},

The approach includes both the effect of the spatial distribution of the foliage elements as well as the slope of the terrain. Two chronosequences consisting of 11 plots were established in two Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in the Central Mountain Range of Spain. 12 hemispherical photographs were taken in each plot and variables related to the stage of development, density, relative spacing and site index were calculated. The gap frequency Poisson model was used to estimate the leaf area index. A new function is proposed to assess the effect of the foliage inclination on light transmittance for Scots pine, based on the assumption that the foliage elements show circular horizontal cross-sections. A new model was also developed to restrict the clumping effect on the vertical component in the Poisson model. The effect of the slope on LAI estimates was determined and included in the model. The results indicate that both the clumping effect correction and the slope correction improve the fitting of the Poisson model to the gap frequency experimental curves, and that the function proposed for the inclination angle correction may provide an acceptable approach for some coniferous species. The relationship between the parameters of the gap fraction model (the foliage inclination angle and the clumping coefficient) and stand level variables, that is, the stage of development, density, spacing of the stand and the site index, is analysed.},

	abstract = {Permanent sample plots (PSP), where trees are individually and permanently marked, have received increased interest in Central Africa as a tool to monitor vegetation changes. Although techniques for mounting PSP in tropical forests are well known, their planning still deserves attention. This study aims at defining a rationale for determining the size and number of replicates for setting up PSP in mixed tropical forests. It considers PSP as a sampling plan to estimate a target quantity with its associated margin of error. The target quantity considered here is the stock recovery rate, which is a key parameter for forest management in Central Africa. It is computed separately for each commercial species. The number of trees to monitor for each species defines the margin of error on the stock recovery rate. The size and number of replicated plots is obtained as the solution of an optimization problem that consists in minimizing the margin of error for every species while ensuring that the mounting cost remains below a given threshold. This rationale was applied using the data from the M’Baïki experimental site in the Central African Republic. It showed that the stock recovery rate is a highly variable quantity, and that the typical cost that forest managers are prone to devote to PSP leads to high margins of error. It also showed that the size and number of replicated plots is related to the spatial pattern of trees: clustered or spatially heterogeneous patterns favor many small plots, whereas regular or spatially homogeneous patterns favor few large plots.},

	abstract = {A pilot study was conducted to determine the optimal survey design for an inventory of the commercially important rattan Calamus poilanei in central Lao PDR. Simulations were used to estimate the coefficients of variation (CVs) of population density estimates for alternative sampling designs, a model was developed to determine the optimal survey design which minimised survey time for a given survey precision and a statistical power analysis was used to determine whether these surveys were sufficiently sensitive to form part of a monitoring programme. Line survey and plot enumeration times were quite high due to moderately difficult terrain. The CV (135\% for a 5m×50m plot) was markedly higher than in some comparable studies. The CV could be predicted well from plot size but plot shape explained little additional variance. The optimum plot size varied but the 5m×50m plot was close to the optimal solution over a wide range of situations. Surveys with a precision of 20\% or better were predicted to be very time consuming. Power analysis indicated that a survey precision of 5 or 10\% was likely to be required if an annual monitoring programme was to be useful in detecting a decline in the population. To achieve this precision, surveys would have to be even more time consuming, and many ‘optimal’ solutions were clearly impractical. For a resource of moderate value such as rattan cane, very prolonged or costly surveys such as these are most unlikely to be economically justified.},

We found that (1) based on the 600 20 m×20 m subplots, basal area and aboveground biomass displayed a high degree of variation, with respective coefficients of variation of 27\% and 31\%; (2) based on the computer simulation analysis, the variability of basal area and aboveground biomass decreased with increasing quadrat size. The number of quadrats required to achieve the specified degree of precision dropped sharply with the increase of quadrat size. However, the total sampling area increased with increasing quadrat size, suggesting that using several small quadrats across the sampling area is more efficient than using fewer larger quadrats. Results of this study are valuable for evaluating the reliability of previous research and may assist researchers in designing effective sampling strategies for future field surveys, particularly in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in China.},

	abstract = {Improved parameters for a soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) are derived using SAIL model output for simulated wheat canopy reflectance. The SAVI is much less sensitive than the ratio vegetation index to changes in background caused by soil colour or surface soil moisture content. The parameters are developed to minimize variability due to soil brightness over the practical range of solar elevations, lear angle distributions (LAD) and leaf area indices (LAI). The parameters are added to the near-infrared (NIR) and red reflectances before calculating the NIR/red ratio. Three new versions of the SAVI are developed based on the theoretical consideration of the effects of wet and dry soils. All three are superior to the NIR/red ratio, the perpendicular vegetation index and a soil-adjusted vegetation index. Our simplest version requires the addition of a parameter to the red reflectance. The second and third versions require an iterative procedure to find the best parameters that are then added to the red or the NIR and red reflectances. In general, SAVI adjustment parameters required to remove soil-brightness effects decrease as factors that obscure the soil-surface increase. Low solar elevation and high LAI result in increasingly negative values for the parameters. The NIR/red ratio is the vegetation index least influenced by soil brightness at LAI greater than three. Our iterated versions have lowest overall errors but are occasionally subject to higher errors at the combination of low zenith angles and erectophile canopies. The SAVI based on the bare soil reflectance performs best on field data.},

	abstract = {A literature survey and analysis of the use of neural networks for the classification of remotely-sensed multi-spectral imagery is presented. As part of a brief mathematical review, the backpropagation algorithm, which is the most common method of training multi-layer networks, is discussed with an emphasis on its application to pattern recognition. The analysis is divided into five aspects of neural network classification: (1) input data preprocessing, structure, and encoding, (2) output encoding and extraction of classes, (3) network architecture, (4) training algorithms, and (5) comparisons to conventional classifiers. The advantages of the neural network method over traditional classifiers are its nonparametric nature, arbitrary decision boundary capabilities, easy adaptation to different types of data and input structures, fuzzy output values that can enhance classification, and good generalization for use with multiple images. The disadvantages of the method are slow training time, inconsistent results due to random initial weights, and the requirement of obscure initialization values (e.g., learning rate and hidden layer size). Possible techniques for ameliorating these problems are discussed. It is concluded that, although the neural network method has several unique capabilities, it will become a useful tool in remote sensing only if it is made faster, more predictable, and easier to use.},

	abstract = {Question: Do rectangular sample plots record more plant species than square plots as suggested by both empirical and theoretical studies? Location: Grasslands, shrublands and forests in the Mediterranean-climate region of California, USA. Methods: We compared three 0.1-ha sampling designs that differed in the shape and dispersion of 1-m2 and 100-m2 nested subplots. We duplicated an earlier study that compared the Whittaker sample design, which had square clustered subplots, with the modified Whittaker design, which had dispersed rectangular subplots. To sort out effects of dispersion from shape we used a third design that overlaid square subplots on the modified Whittaker design. Also, using data from published studies we extracted species richness values for 400-m2 subplots that were either square or 1:4 rectangles partially overlaid on each other from desert scrub in high and low rainfall years, chaparral, sage scrub, oak savanna and coniferous forests with and without fire. Results: We found that earlier empirical reports of more than 30\% greater richness with rectangles were due to the confusion of shape effects with spatial effects, coupled with the use of cumulative number of species as the metric for comparison. Average species richness was not significantly different between square and 1:4 rectangular sample plots at either 1- or 100-m2. Pairwise comparisons showed no significant difference between square and rectangular samples in all but one vegetation type, and that one exhibited significantly greater richness with squares. Our three intensive study sites appear to exhibit some level of self-similarity at the scale of 400 m2, but, contrary to theoretical expectations, we could not detect plot shape effects on species richness at this scale. Conclusions: At the 0.1-ha scale or lower there is no evidence that plot shape has predictable effects on number of species recorded from sample plots. We hypothesize that for the mediterranean-climate vegetation types studied here, the primary reason that 1:4 rectangles do not sample greater species richness than squares is because species turnover varies along complex environmental gradients that are both parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of rectangular plots. Reports in the literature of much greater species richness recorded for highly elongated rectangular strips than for squares of the same area are not likely to be fair comparisons because of the dramatically different periphery/area ratio, which includes a much greater proportion of species that are using both above and below-ground niche space outside the sample area.},

Using data drawn from two large permanent forest sample plots in Malaysia, we tested the ability of the Malaysian SMS pre-felling inventory (Pre-F) to accurately assess alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tree diversity. We found that the Pre-F did not accurately estimate variation in α-diversity at small spatial-scales, but could be used to accurately extrapolate α-diversity on larger spatial scales. The Pre-F also adequately assessed β-diversity in heterogeneous environments, but did not perform as well in homogeneous environments. The use of tree species codes as opposed to Latin nomenclature affected estimates of β- but not α-diversity.},

One approach is developing sampling designs that integrate expert knowledge. 3P sampling does so by selecting samples with probability proportional to prediction (3P). Higher effort is allocated to areas with high species richness based on predictions made on the ground. 3P sampling for RBA was simulated considering two major factors: knowledge of plant species and types of rapid assessment. Two large census forest plots over 25 ha in size were used. Results showed that sampling error of 3P sampling for RBA was relatively low and could be improved by changing methods of prediction. Sampling was more efficient and accurate when predictions were made with knowledge about abundant species instead of random species. When such prediction was made, knowing only three quarters of the total species richness in a forest performed as well as full knowledge. Randomly walking around in an area and predicting also increased efficiency and accuracy compared to standing stationary at an assessment point. This was counterintuitive to the common practices of establishing ground plots for assessment. Our findings propose that 3P sampling for RBA is workable through engaging local communities in an assessment, which could be cost-effective. Finally, the procedure laid out in this study is the first unequal probability sampling design proposed for RBA.},

	abstract = {Grasslands are one of the ecosystems that have been strongly affected by anthropogenic impacts. The state-of-the-art in monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is seen as an alternative to community-oriented remote sensing depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species reflectance. An AISA+ imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold was used to scan 1m2 grassland plots and assess the impact of four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1) the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e. species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs). Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine classification with a linear kernel, obtaining a median Kappa of {\textasciitilde}0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r2 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of {\textasciitilde}0.6 and {\textasciitilde}6.2\% respectively. We found that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly structural diversity) were the most important sources of variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A spatial resolution below 1cm produced relatively good models for estimating species-specific coverages (r2={\textasciitilde}0.6; RMSE={\textasciitilde}7.5\%) while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed in this individual-oriented approach (r2={\textasciitilde}0.17; RMSE={\textasciitilde}20.7\%). Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that the application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing in environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.},

	abstract = {Climate change is influencing tree phenology, causing earlier and more prolonged canopy closure in temperate forests. Canopy closure is closely associated with understorey light, so shifts in its timing have wide-reaching consequences for ecological processes in the understorey. Widespread monitoring of forest canopies through time is needed to understand changes in light availability during spring in particular. Canopy openness, derived from hemispherical photography, has frequently been used as a proxy for understorey light. However, hemispherical photography is relatively resource intensive, so we tested a range of inexpensive alternatives for monitoring variability in canopy closure (visual estimation, canopy scope, smartphone photography, smartphone photography with fisheye attachment; and image analysis with specialist hemispherical photography software or with simpler, open access image analysis software). Smartphone photography with an inexpensive fisheye lens attachment proved the most reliable estimator of canopy closure. We found no significant difference in canopy estimations from three widely-owned smartphone models with differing resolutions and fields of view, and no significant effect of camera operator on the results. ImageJ, a free image analysis software, detected canopy variability in a similar way to HemiView specialist hemispherical photography software. We recommend a combination of smartphone photography with fisheye attachment and analysis with ImageJ for identifying changes in the timing of canopy closure (but not for estimating absolute canopy closure). We discuss how large-scale citizen science using this approach could generate meaningful and comparative data on the timings of canopy closure in different forests, year-to-year.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for detecting the horizon line in digital images, which employs an edge-based and a new color-based horizon detection technique. The color-based detector calculates an estimate of the horizon line by analyzing the color transition in the clear sky areas of the image. The edge-based detector computes the horizon line by finding the most prominent line or edge in the image, based on Canny edge detection and Hough transformation. The proposed algorithm combines the two detectors into a hybrid detection system, thereby taking advantage of their complimentary strengths. We have applied the algorithm on a manually annotated set of images and evaluated the accuracy of the position and angle of the detected horizon line. The experiments indicate the usefulness of the proposed color-based detector (40\% lower error vs. the edge-based detector) and the benefit of the adopted approach for combining the two individual detectors (57\% and 17\% lower error vs. the edge-based and the color-based detectors, respectively).},

Computer vision has and will continue to play an important role in increasing autonomy of both spacecraft and Earth-based robotic vehicles. This article addresses progress on computer vision for planetary rovers and landers and has four main parts. First, we review major milestones in the development of computer vision for robotic vehicles over the last four decades. Since research on applications for Earth and space has often been closely intertwined, the review includes elements of both. Second, we summarize the design and performance of computer vision algorithms used on Mars in the NASA/JPL Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, which was a major step forward in the use of computer vision in space. These algorithms did stereo vision and visual odometry for rover navigation and feature tracking for horizontal velocity estimation for the landers. Third, we summarize ongoing research to improve vision systems for planetary rovers, which includes various aspects of noise reduction, FPGA implementation, and vision-based slip perception. Finally, we briefly survey other opportunities for computer vision to impact rovers, landers, and orbiters in future solar system exploration missions.},

	abstract = {The leaf area index, LAI, representing the physiological and structural functions of vegetation canopies, can be estimated from gap fraction measurements obtained at different zenith angles. Earlier works have provided practical and convenient theoretical solution to retrieve LAI based on the integration of contact numbers (a projected area of leaves on a plane perpendicular to the view or solar zenith angle) over zenith angles as obtained by a linear regression, i.e., LAI=2(A+B), where A and B are the coefficients of the regression of contact numbers against zenith angles. This graphical procedure is equivalent to the more accurate method of LAI retrieval by integrating gap fraction measurements from nadir through horizon angles. However, using an ordinary least-squares regression on inherently unsteady relationship between contact numbers and zenith angles limited the use of a simple graphical procedure for LAI estimation. In this study, we introduce the use of robust procedure to retrieve regression coefficients (i.e., A and B), and assess the performance of the new procedure using numerically derived hypothetical data, computer simulated and real measurements of hemispherical photographs. Our results indicated, the new procedure not only outperformed the ordinary least-squares solution for graphical procedure, but also outperformed all existing LAI methods We conclude from analyses using numerically derived hypothetical data, computer simulated and real measurements of hemispherical photographs that estimating A and B (where LAI=2(A+B)) using a robust procedure is a convenient and sufficiently accurate method for estimating LAI from field measurements of gap fractions at different zenith angles.},

In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "excellent" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "poor". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive.

SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results.

Green area index (GAI) is a key agronomic variable involved in many processes and used for decision making. This paper describes a physically based algorithm for estimating GAI from UAS acquisitions. The UAS plane platform used here was equipped with four cameras in green (550nm), red (660nm), red-edge (735nm) and near infrared (790nm). It provided multiple views by overlapping images along and between the tracks. A lookup table was generated to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using the reflectances in the four bands and the specific view-sun angles for each individual image. The average of the ensemble of solutions corresponding to the individual images allows regularizing the solutions of the ill posed inverse problem. Around six images were required to get stable GAI estimates and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) value was used as a proxy for the associated uncertainties. Comparison with ground based measurements showed that the accuracy of UAS GAI estimates over wheat and rapeseed crops was around 0.2 in terms of RMSE. The use of normalized reflectances compared to absolute reflectances improved the performances of GAI estimates (0.17 compared to 0.26 GAI in terms of RMSE) particularly under unstable illumination conditions. High repeatability in the estimates from UAS flights at different acquisition times was observed. The use of the red-edge band normalized (absolute) reflectances brought 30\% (10\%) improvement of accuracy for the low to medium GAI values.},

Using an area of limestone grassland as an illustrative example, the sample size required to characterize a wide range of grassland fields was determined. With a maximum of 5\% error at the 95\% confidence level the minimum sample size per field was noted to vary between 1–58 for ground radiometric and airborne multispectral scanner measurements and 142–293 for green leaf area index measurements. The collection of such large sample sizes is unusual in remote sensing.

In this paper, we present an algorithm for segmenting trees from a complex scene. The trunk and leaf regions of a tree can be individually identified and the trunk structure of the tree can also be extracted. The pro- posed algorithm is mainly composed of a preliminary im- age segmentation, a trunk structure extraction, and a leaf regions identification process. We model the extraction of trunk structure as an optimization problem, where an en- ergy function is formulated according to the color, position, and orientation of the segmented regions. We propose an algorithm to minimize this energy function and thus extract the trunk structure of the tree. After obtaining the trunk structure, the leaf regions can then be easily identified by finding those leaf regions located above the trunk regions. This algorithm has been tested on some real images and the results indicated that our algorithm performed well for these images.},

Thus, the development of integrative and quantitative tools for the monitoring and spatial characterization of microclimates across spatial scales is a key issue for climate change ecologists. * We proposed an integrative toolbox for quantifying the spatial heterogeneity in surface temperatures by bringing together procedures of unmanned aerial vehicles, thermal imagery, orthomosaic, GIS classification and spatial metrics. This toolbox permits to yield high-resolution visual and infrared orthoimages that are processed into a GIS for selecting surfaces of interest in the landscape (e.g. soil, vegetation). Then, the thermal matrices of selected surfaces (i.e. temperature values of the pixels belonging to the selected surfaces only) are processed within r to generate a variety of thermal landscape metrics (e.g. thermal patch richness and density, thermal aggregation and cohesion index). * We applied this toolbox to the thermal characterization of mountainous agricultural landscapes in Ecuador with implications for ectothermic pest dynamics. UAV flights at a height of 60 m above-ground level allowed us to acquired high-resolution visual and thermal images (1 and 5 cm/pixel, respectively) for 12 potato fields with a mean surface of 1017 ± 117 m2. Landscape metrics on plant and soil surfaces showed that crop phenology drives the spatial patterns of surface temperatures and strongly modifies the overall thermal ecology of crop fields, with potential implications for ectothermic pest occurrence and dynamics. * Overall, our toolbox affords a timely and innovative methodological framework to better assess the thermal heterogeneity of natural landscapes across a wide range of spatial scales. In particular, this toolbox would be of topical interest for ecologists trying to bridge the gap between the resolution of their climatic data and the body size of their study organisms.},

	abstract = {This study investigates whether a water deficit index (WDI) based on imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide accurate crop water stress maps at different growth stages of barley and in differing weather situations. Data from both the early and late growing season are included to investigate whether the WDI has the unique potential to be applicable both when the land surface is partly composed of bare soil and when crops on the land surface are senescing. The WDI differs from the more commonly applied crop water stress index (CWSI) in that it uses both a spectral vegetation index (VI), to determine the degree of surface greenness, and the composite land surface temperature (LST) (not solely canopy temperature). Lightweight thermal and RGB (red-green-blue) cameras were mounted on a UAV on three occasions during the growing season 2014, and provided composite LST and color images, respectively. From the LST, maps of surface-air temperature differences were computed. From the color images, the normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), constituting the indicator of surface greenness, was computed. Advantages of the WDI as an irrigation map, as compared with simpler maps of the surface-air temperature difference, are discussed, and the suitability of the NGRDI is assessed. Final WDI maps had a spatial resolution of 0.25 m. It was found that the UAV-based WDI is in agreement with measured stress values from an eddy covariance system. Further, the WDI is especially valuable in the late growing sea-son because at this stage the remote sensing data represent crop water availability to a greater extent than they do in the early growing season, and because the WDI accounts for areas of ripe crops that no longer have the same need for irrigation. WDI maps can potentially serve as water stress maps, showing the farmer where irrigation is needed to ensure healthy growing plants, during entire growing season.},

The phenopix R package includes all steps in data processing. It enables the user to: draw a region of interest (ROI) on an image; extract red green and blue digital numbers (DN) from a seasonal series of images; depict greenness index trajectories; fit a curve to the seasonal trajectories; extract relevant phenological thresholds (phenophases); extract phenophase uncertainties. The software capabilities are illustrated by analyzing one year of data from a selection of seven sites belonging to the PhenoCam network (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/), including an unmanaged subalpine grassland, a tropical grassland, a deciduous needle-leaf forest, three deciduous broad-leaf temperate forests and an evergreen needle-leaf forest. One of the novelties introduced by the package is the spatially explicit, pixel-based analysis, which potentially allows to extract within-ecosystem or within-individual variability of phenology. We examine the relationship between phenophases extracted by the traditional ROI-averaged and the novel pixel-based approaches, and further illustrate potential applications of pixel-based image analysis available in the phenopix R package.},

	url = {https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/855},
	abstract = {This project describes a technique for segmenting regions of sky in an image from the remainder of the image. This segmentation technique is part of a method for predicting the solar exposure at a location of interest from a set of photographs. Given the latitude and longitude of the position and the direction and field of view of the camera it is possible to calculate the position of the sun in the image at a particular time on a particular day.  If that position is in a sky region of the image then the location will be exposed to the sun at that time. 

Critical to the success of this method for determining solar exposure is the image processing used to separate the sky from the rest of the image. This work is concerned with finding a technique which can do this for images taken under different weather conditions. The general approach to separate the sky from the rest of the image is to use the Canny edge detector and the morphology closing algorithm to find the regions in the image. The brightness and area of each region are then used to determine which regions are sky. The FloodFill algorithm is applied to identify all pixels in each sky region.

An extensive empirical study is used to find a set of threshold values for the Canny edge detector, applied to the blue colour channel, which allow successful identification of the sky regions in a wide range of images. Tests using different camera filters show that they do not usefully increase the contrast between the sky and the rest of the image, when a standard compact camera is used. The work reported in this thesis shows that this approach of finding edges to identify possible sky regions works successfully on a wide range of images although there will always be situations, such as when the image is taken directly into the sun, where manual adjustment to the identified regions may be required.},

	abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease is one of the most important diseases affecting citrus orchards in Florida and other parts of the world. The first critical step for a successful control of HLB is its detection and diagnosis. Spectroscopy has proven to yield reliable results for its early detection, minimizing the time consumed for this process. This study presents a new approach of high-resolution aerial imaging for HLB detection using a low-cost, low-altitude remote sensing multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A multi-band imaging sensor was attached to a UAV that is capable of acquiring aerial images at desired resolution by adjusting the flying altitude. Moreover, the results achieved using UAV-based sensors were compared with a similar imaging system (aircraft-based sensors) with lower spatial resolution. Data comprised of six spectral bands (from 530 to 900nm) and seven vegetation indices derived from the selected bands. Stepwise regression analysis was used to extract relevant features from UAV-based and aircraft-based spectral images. At both spatial resolutions, 710nm reflectance and NIR-R index values were found to be significantly different between healthy and HLB-infected trees. During classification studies, accuracies in the range of 67–85\% and false negatives from 7\% to 32\% were acquired from UAV-based data; while corresponding values were 61–74\% and 28–45\% with aircraft-based data. Among the tested classification algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) with kernel resulted in better performance than other methods such as SVM (linear), linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis. Thus, high-resolution aerial sensing has good prospect for the detection of HLB-infected trees.},

No ground-based reflectance measurements could be made for validation of these data. Therefore the land surface NDVI, which varied with time, and percentage vegetation cover of the test areas were deduced from time-independent but site-specific statistical land use data updated by temporal phenological observations, and from surface-specific reflectance curves published in the literature. The result indicated that the area-averaged NDVI, as obtained from the NOAA—11 radiometer, was less than the value calculated from the land surface NDVI. After correction to reduce the offset of the data, the values would be a suitable indicator of the fraction of vegetation cover.},

In the semi-arid woodlands the lowest errors of measurement (C.V. = 12-14\%) were associated with point measures of canopy cover, while in the chenopod shrublands the most precise measure in most situations was the density of shrub clumps (C.V. = 12-16\%). Measures of herbaceous and litter cover had a high error of measurement (e.g. C.V. = 60\%) and observers were significantly different. The point measurement of the area of degraded soil surface was reliable on duplex soils, but not on gradational soils. The results are discussed in terms of their application for the monitoring of change in range condition. It is concluded that the most appropriate measure of the shrub layer is foliar cover in woodlands and clump density in chenopod shrublands.},

ET measured from nine flux towers (eddy covariance and Bowen ratio) established in plant communities dominated by five major plant types on the Middle Rio Grande, Upper San Pedro River, and Lower Colorado River was strongly correlated with Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor on the NASA Terra satellite. The inclusion of maximum daily air temperatures (Ta) measured at the tower sites further improved this relationship. Sixteen-day composite values of EVI and Ta were combined to predict ET across species and tower sites (r2=0.74); the regression equation was used to scale ET for 2000–2004 over large river reaches with Ta from meteorological stations. Measured and estimated ET values for these river segments were moderate when compared to historical, and often indirect, estimates and ranged from 851–874 mm yr−1. ET of individual plant communities ranged more widely. Cottonwood (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) stands generally had the highest annual ET rates (1100–1300 mm yr−1), while mesquite (Prosopis velutina) (400–1100 mm yr−1) and saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) (300–1300 mm yr−1) were intermediate, and giant sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii) (500–800 mm yr−1) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) (300–700 mm yr−1) were the lowest. ET rates estimated from the flux towers and by remote sensing in this study were much lower than values estimated for riparian water budgets using crop coefficient methods for the Middle Rio Grande and Lower Colorado River.},

	abstract = {The superficial appearance and color of food are the first parameters of quality evaluated by consumers, and are thus critical factors for acceptance of the food item by the consumer. Although there are different color spaces, the most used of these in the measuring of color in food is the L∗a∗b∗ color space due to the uniform distribution of colors, and because it is very close to human perception of color. In order to carry out a digital image analysis in food, it is necessary to know the color measure of each pixel on the surface of the food item. However, there are at present no commercial L∗a∗b∗ color measures in pixels available because the existing commercial colorimeters generally measure small, non-representative areas of a few square centimeters. Given that RGB digital cameras obtain information in pixels, this article presents a computational solution that allows the obtaining of digital images in L∗a∗b∗ color units for each pixel of the digital RGB image. This investigation presents five models for the RGB→L∗a∗b∗ conversion and these are: linear, quadratic, gamma, direct, and neural network. Additionally, a method is suggested for estimating the parameters of the models based on a minimization of the mean absolute error between the color measurements obtained by the models, and by a commercial colorimeter for uniform and homogenous surfaces. In the evaluation of the performance of the models, the neural network model stands out with an error of only 0.93\%. On the basis of the construction of these models, it is possible to find a L∗a∗b∗ color measuring system that is appropriate for an accurate, exacting and detailed characterization of a food item, thus improving quality control and providing a highly useful tool for the food industry based on a color digital camera.},

This study explores the potential of deriving these two variables from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Obviously, one NDVI measurement does not allow simultaneous derivation of both vegetation variables. Simple models of a satellite pixel are used to illustrate the ambiguity resulting from a combination of the unknown horizontal (fg) and vertical (Lg) densities. We argue that for NOAA AVHRR data sets based on observations with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres the most appropriate way to resolve this ambiguity is to assume that the vegetated part of a pixel is covered by dense vegetation (i.e., its leaf area index is high), and to calculate fg=(NDVI-NDVI0)/(NDVI8-NDVI0), where NDVIo (bare soil) and NDVI (dense vegetation) are specified as global constants independent of vegetation/soil type. Global (0.15o)2 spatial resolution monthly maps of fg were produced from a 5-year NDVI climatology and incorporated in the NWS models. As a result, the model surface fluxes were improved.},

Norway spruce dominated plots using the Cajanus tube, line intersect sampling, modified
spherical densiometer, digital photographs, and ocular estimation. The comparisons were based
on the differences in values acquired with selected techniques and control values acquired
with the Cajanus tube. The statistical significance of the differences between the techniques
was tested with the nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance and multiple comparisons.
The results indicate that different techniques yield considerably different canopy
cover estimates. In general, labour intensive techniques (the Cajanus tube, line intersect
sampling) provide unbiased and more precise estimates, whereas the estimates provided by
fast techniques (digital photographs, ocular estimation) have larger variances and may also
be seriously biased.},

Remote-sensing inversion is a common approach to estimating FVC. However, there is an important gap between ground-based surveys (quadrat level) and remote-sensing imagery (satellite image pixel scale) from satellites. In this study we evaluated that gap with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial images of alpine grassland on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that: (1) the most accurate estimations of FVC came from UAV (FVCUAV) at the satellite image pixel scale, and when FVC was estimated using ground-based surveys (FVCground), the accuracy increased as the number of quadrats used increased and was inversely proportional to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface condition; (2) the UAV method was more efficient than conventional ground-based survey methods at the satellite image pixel scale; and (3) the coefficient of determination (R2) between FVCUAV and vegetation indices (VIs) was significantly greater than that between FVCground and VIs (p {\textless} 0.05, n = 5). Our results suggest that the use of UAV to estimate FVC at the satellite image pixel scale provides more accurate results and is more efficient than conventional ground-based survey methods.},

Based on GPP phenology estimation in GPP, the growing season determined by SIF time-series is shorter in length than the growing season length determined solely using NDVI. This is mainly due to the extended period of high NDVI values, as compared to SIF, by about 46days (±11days), indicating a large-scale seasonal decoupling of physiological activity and changes in greenness in the fall. In addition to phenological timing, mean seasonal NDVI and SIF have different responses to temperature changes throughout the growing season. We observed that both NDVI and SIF linearly increased with temperature increases throughout the spring. However, in the fall, although NDVI linearly responded to temperature increases, SIF and GPP did not linearly increase with temperature increases, implying a seasonal hysteresis of SIF and GPP in response to temperature changes across boreal ecosystems throughout their growing season. Seasonal hysteresis of vegetation at large-scales is consistent with the known phenomena that light limits boreal forest ecosystem productivity in the fall. Our results suggest that continuing measurements from satellite remote sensing of both SIF and NDVI can help to understand the differences between, and information carried by, seasonal variations vegetation structure and greenness and physiology at large-scales across the critical boreal regions.},

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.

The development of conservation priorities in the tropics is often hampered by the sparseness of ground data on biological diversity and the relative crudeness of larger-scale remote sensing data. Asner et al. developed airborne instrumentation to make large-scale maps of forest functional diversity across 72 million hectares of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon basin (see the Perspective by Kapos). They generated a suite of forest canopy functional trait maps from laser-guided imaging spectroscopy and used them to define distinct forest functional classes. These were then compared with government deforestation and land allocation data, which enabled an analysis of conservation threats and opportunities across the region.
Science, this issue p. 385; see also p. 347
Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53\% of each mapped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.

Newer technologies, such as imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (lidar), are just now reaching performance levels that will allow monitoring of tropical forest diversity from the air, but the methods for applying these technologies are not yet ready. Here, we present concepts that combine chemical and spectral remote sensing perspectives to facilitate canopy diversity mapping.

The terrestrial biosphere absorbs about a quarter of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but the amount that they take up varies from year to year. Why? Combining models and observations, Ahlström et al. found that marginal ecosystems—semiarid savannas and low-latitude shrublands—are responsible for most of the variability. Biological productivity in these semiarid regions is water-limited and strongly associated with variations in precipitation, unlike wetter tropical areas. Understanding carbon uptake by these marginal lands may help to improve predictions of variations in the global carbon cycle.
Science, this issue p. 895
The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since industrialization is characterized by large interannual variability, mostly resulting from variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (typically termed carbon sink). However, the contributions of regional ecosystems to that variability are not well known. Using an ensemble of ecosystem and land-surface models and an empirical observation-based product of global gross primary production, we show that the mean sink, trend, and interannual variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by distinct biogeographic regions. Whereas the mean sink is dominated by highly productive lands (mainly tropical forests), the trend and interannual variability of the sink are dominated by semi-arid ecosystems whose carbon balance is strongly associated with circulation-driven variations in both precipitation and temperature.
Semi-arid regions cause most of the interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon dioxide sink.

	abstract = {Logging harvesters represent a set of high-performance modern forestry machinery, which can finish a series of continuous operations such as felling, delimbing, peeling, bucking and so forth with human intervention. It is found by experiment that during the process of the alignment of the harvesting head to capture the trunk, the operator needs a lot of observation, judgment and repeated operations, which lead to the time and fuel losses. In order to improve the operation efficiency and reduce the operating costs, the point clouds for standing trees are collected with a low-cost 2D laser scanner. A cluster extracting algorithm and filtering algorithm are used to classify each trunk from the point cloud. On the assumption that every cross section of the target trunk is approximate a standard circle and combining the information of an Attitude and Heading Reference System, the radii and center locations of the trunks in the scanning range are calculated by the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithm. The method is validated through experiments in an aspen forest, and the optimized calculation time consumption is compared with the previous work of other researchers. Moreover, the implementation of the calculation result for automotive capturing trunks by the harvesting head during the logging operation is discussed in particular.},

	abstract = {We studied plant communities before and after two types of clearcutting to determine their response and their relationships to disturbance intensity and to make management recommendations. Permanent plots sampled before and for 2 years after harvesting were used to compare changes in the herbaceous layer for 2 years after harvest in three treatments: clearcutting with natural regeneration (C), clearcutting with mechanical site preparation and planting (CS) and uncut control (UC). The greatest compositional changes occurred in the CS treatment, where 16 species were lost and 20 new species were gained compared to 14 lost and 16 gained in the C treatment. The number of forest habitat species decreased 20–24\% by the second year after harvest in both treated areas. Species that were lost included Cypripedium acaule, Monotropa hypopithys, Orthilia secunda, Ribes lacustre, Streptopus amplexifolius, Thelypteris noveboracensis and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. The number and cover of disturbance-adapted species increased about 250\% in the CS treatment compared to 200\% for the C treatment. Mean total species richness per plot, Shannon–Wiener, Simpson and evenness diversity indices were significantly greater (P\&lt;0.05) the second year after harvest than before harvest in the two harvest treatments. Richness of forest species significantly declined in both treated areas. Sørensen’s similarity index (each post-harvest year versus pre-harvest) increased with time in all treatments and was lowest in the CS treatment. Cover of most growth forms, especially bryophytes, decreased after harvesting in the two harvest areas, whereas small trees/shrubs and graminoids increased, particularly in the CS treatment. Cover of conifer seedlings and bryophytes greatly decreased in the C treatment where coniferous stand types dominated before harvest. Four non-native taxa (Plantago major, Ranunculus acris, Taraxacum officinale and Veronica officinalis) were encountered in the study. In 1997, total cover of non-natives was 0.2\% in the CS treatment and \&lt;0.05\% in the C and UC treatments. We conclude that the more dramatic changes in species composition and diversity in the CS treatment are the result of greater forest floor disturbance caused by site preparation. Protection of forest understory plants can be improved by minimizing forest floor disturbance, maintaining shade cover and leaving uncut strips or patches in areas containing species that are sensitive to harvesting.},

The method was used in this study to approximate the variance of predictions made with a variation of the individual tree growth and yield model, STEMS (Stand and Tree Evaluation and Modeling System). The method was compared with a crude Monte Carlo method for obtaining simulation variances. At its worse, the error propagation approximation of standard deviation diverged from the Monte Carlo approximation by 16\% for a 50-year projection. The technique reduced execution time for calculating the variances by a factor of almost 2,000.},

The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and the size of each plot was 200 m2. On the average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality.

A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding characteristics of entire forest stands was tested. Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m2 regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics were predicted for each grid cell from the corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated regression equations. Average values for each stand was computed.

	abstract = {The number of species in an area is critical to the development of evolutionary and ecological theory from mass extinctions to island biogeography. Still, the factors influencing the accuracy of estimators of species richness are poorly understood. We explored these factors by simulating landscapes that varied in species richness, relative abundances, and the spatial distribution. We compared the extrapolations of nine nonparametric estimators and two species accumulation curves under three sampling intensities. Community evenness of species' abundances, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness significantly influenced bias, precision, and accuracy of the estimations. Perhaps most surprisingly, the effects of gradient strength and spatial autocorrelation type were generally insignificant. The nonparametric estimators were substantially less biased and more precise than the species accumulation curves. Observed species richness was most biased. Community evenness, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness influenced the performance of the nonparametric estimators indirectly via the fraction of all species found in a sample or "sample coverage." For each particular level of sample coverage, a single estimator was most accurate. Choice of estimator is confounded by a priori uncertainty about the sample coverage. Accordingly, researchers can extrapolate species richness by various estimators and base the estimator choice on the mean estimated sample coverage. Alternatively, the most reliable estimator with respect to community evenness can be chosen. These predictions from our simulations are confirmed in two field studies.},

We demonstrate that the line methods can be interpreted as applications of importance sampling and that point methods can be interpreted as two-stage applications of importance sampling and crude Monte Carlo. Interestingly, each of the line methods also can be implemented as a point method. Operationally, the two stages of a point method effectively reduce to a single stage. Estimators of target parameters are derived from the Monte Carlo approach for all six methods.

Using a π/2 radian relascope angle, the method becomes invariant to the orientation of the line objects in the population. The reason is that the area of inclusion around objects, through which a survey line should pass for an object to be included, turns out to be circular. In analytical studies and Monte Carlo simulations, the cost‐efficiency of transect relascope and line intersect sampling is evaluated. It is found that transect relascope sampling is a competitive alternative to line intersect sampling in inventories of the total volume of coarse woody debris (in the form of downed logs) in forest compartments.},

	abstract = {Logs are an important structural feature of forest ecosystems, and their abundance affects many resources and forest processes, including fire regimes, soil productivity, silviculture, carbon cycling, and wildlife habitat. Consequently, logs are often sampled to estimate their frequency, percent cover, volume, and weight. The line-intersect method (LIM) is one of the most widely used methods to obtain these estimates and has been shown to produce unbiased estimates of log characteristics. With the traditional LIM the diameters of each log at the point of its intersection with the sampling transect are used to estimate log characteristics. Based on a simulation study and a large set of empirical data, we found that use of intersect log diameters to define size classes provided biased estimates of log characteristics. The bias varied by diameter class. Results from the simulation study showed that log frequency and volume were overestimated in small-diameter log classes and underestimated in large-diameter classes. Similarly, results from our empirical analysis showed a 40\% overestimate of log volume in the smallest diameter class (15–25 cm), and a 31\% underestimate of volume in the largest diameter class ({\textgreater}50 cm). Just as size classes of snags and trees are best defined by their diameter-at-breast height (DBH), size classes of logs should be defined by their large-end diameters (LEDs). When large-end diameters of logs were used instead of diameters measured at the point of transect intersection, bias was substantially reduced or eliminated. These results indicate that line-intersect sampling could be substantially improved by including measurements of LEDs to estimate log characteristics. Our results have far-reaching implications for estimates of log characteristics, such as estimates of fuel loading and subsequent wildfire risk, carbon source and sink dynamics, silviculture, nutrient cycling, and habitat for wildlife. Without our suggested correction to line-intersect sampling, many forest resources associated with log characteristics will not be estimated accurately, affecting a plethora of log-based management and research programs.},

	abstract = {Estimating prediction uncertainty for a single tree-based model is hindered by the complex structure of these models. In this paper, we addressed this issue with a case study applied to northern hardwood stands in Québec, Canada. SaMARE is a stochastic single tree-based model that was designed for these types of stands. Using a Monte Carlo approach, the model can provide a mean predicted value and its confidence limits for some plot-level attributes.

The mean predicted values were compared to observed values in terms of bias and accuracy. In addition to these common statistics, we compared nominal coverage of Monte Carlo-simulated confidence intervals with real (observed) coverage to verify the adequacy of the simulated uncertainty. A comparison was made using several plot-level attributes, which exhibited an increasing discriminative complexity. This complexity ranges from coarse attributes, such as all-species basal area, up to more complex ones, such as basal area for stems of a particular species and with sawlog potential.

The results showed that in terms of absolute value, biases were small, but could be relatively high with respect to the average observed value when the discriminative complexity of the attribute increased. The comparison between nominal and real coverage of confidence intervals gave satisfactory results for all-species plot-level attributes. However, for some species-specific attributes, the Monte Carlo-simulated confidence intervals overestimated the real coverage.},

	abstract = {Individual-tree volumes are primarily predicted using volume equations that rely on measured tree attributes. In the northeastern United States, the Forest Inventory and Analysis program determines tree volume using dbh, bole height, proportion of cull, and species information. These measurements are subject to variability due to a host of factors. The sensitivity of the volume equations were assessed in relation to changes in each of the input variables. Additionally, data from 3,345 trees that were independently remeasured were used to assess differences in gross and net volumes between operational and audit measurements. Evaluations were conducted for dbh, bole height, and proportion of cull classes, across 18 different species groups. Differences in bole height and proportion cull measurements were found to contribute the most to volume differences. Surprisingly, trees with relatively short bole heights were affected more than trees having taller bole heights. Differences in dbh and species identification contributed little to the volume differences. An analysis of the full data set across all realized volume differences showed no statistical bias in either gross or net volume. These results show the influence that specific field measurements have on accurate estimation of volume, which may be useful for targeting specific attributes where additional training or refined measurement protocols could improve consistency.},

The model represents multiple scattering of light within the canopy and with the ground surface, simulates the return signal efficiently at multiple wavebands and includes the effects of topography. LiDAR-emitted pulse and spatial and temporal sampling characteristics of the instrument are explicitly modelled. Agreement is found between the integrated waveform energy and directly derived bidirectional reflectance factors from FLIGHT (root mean square error {\textless}0.01), and between simulated and observed Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) waveforms for a complex forest site. A sensitivity analysis gives expected effects of canopy parameters on the waveform, and indicates potential for retrieval of the canopy properties of fractional cover and leaf area, in addition to height. Where canopy and ground pulses can be separated, an index derived from the waveform shows theoretical retrieval of vertically projected plant area index with correlation coefficient R2=0.87.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimates of vegetation structure are important for a large number of applications including ecological modeling and carbon budgets. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measures the three-dimensional structure of vegetation using laser beams. Most LiDAR applications today rely on airborne platforms for data acquisitions, which typically record between 1 and 5 "discrete" returns for each outgoing laser pulse. Although airborne LiDAR allows sampling of canopy characteristics at stand and landscape level scales, this method is largely insensitive to below canopy biomass, such as understorey and trunk volumes, as these elements are often occluded by the upper parts of the crown, especially in denser canopies. As a supplement to airborne laser scanning (ALS), a number of recent studies used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for the biomass estimation in spatially confined areas. One such instrument is the Echidna® Validation Instrument (EVI), which is configured to fully digitize the returned energy of an emitted laser pulse to establish a complete profile of the observed vegetation elements. In this study we assess and compare a number of canopy metrics derived from airborne and TLS. Three different experiments were conducted using discrete return ALS data and discrete and full waveform observations derived from the EVI. Although considerable differences were found in the return distribution of both systems, ALS and TLS were both able to accurately determine canopy height (Δ height {\textless}2.5 m) and the vertical distribution of foliage and leaf area (0.86 {\textgreater} r2 {\textgreater}0.90, p{\textless}0.01). When using more spatially explicit approaches for modeling the biomass and volume throughout the stands, the differences between ALS and TLS observations were more distinct; however, predictable patterns exist based on sensor position and configuration.},

However, the long-term implications of using either ba or dbh for predictions are rarely fully assessed. In this analysis, Δba and Δdbh increment equations were fit to identical datasets gathered from six conifer and four hardwood species grown in central Maine. The performance of Δba and Δdbh predictions from nonlinear mixed-effects models were then compared with observed growth measurements of up to 29 years via a Monte Carlo simulation. Two evaluation statistics indicated substantial improvement in forecasting dbh using Δdbh rather than Δba. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and percentage mean absolute deviation (MAD\%) were reduced by 14\% and 15\% on average, respectively, across all projection length intervals (5–29 years) when Δdbh was used over Δba. Differences were especially noted as projection lengths increased. RMSE and MAD\% were reduced by 24\% when Δdbh was employed over Δba at longer projection lengths (up to 29 years). Simulations found that simulating random effects rather than using local estimates for random effects performed as well or better at longer interval lengths. These results highlight the implications that selecting a growth model dependent variable can have and the importance of incorporating model uncertainty into the growth projections of individual tree based models.},

For these indices the reduction in mean square error relative to no competition index was used to judge performance. The performance of these indices varies by species and growth component (height or diameter² growth), but performance was generally better for tolerant white fir than for intolerant ponderosa pine. Additional competition measures that incorporate estimated crown parameters were developed and shown to improve on many of the traditional competition measures especially for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. For white fir, basal area performed well, but not as well as the individual tree competition indices that incorporate estimated crown parameters. We found that expanding the search zone did not improve our ability to estimate competitive effects. Choosing competitors with a height angle gauge was generally superior to selecting them with a DBH angle gauge.

LIDAR sensing geometry is explicitly modelled in the domain of scan space, a threedimensional
analogue to two-dimensional image space. Prior models for object configurations take the form of Markov marked point processes, where pair-wise object interactions depend upon object attributes. Inferences are based upon the posterior distribution of the object configuration given the observed LIDAR. Given the complexity of the posterior distribution, inferences are based upon dependent samples generated via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

In this study, 105 plots located west of the Kenai Mountains, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska were measured and LiDAR data over the same set of field plots were acquired. Plot tree height, stand height, LiDAR mean height and LiDAR 90th percentile height were computed. Using the Matern covariance model for constant mean Gaussian spatial process, ordinary kriging was implemented and contour maps of predicted plot-level height from field height measurements and from LiDAR data were produced over the entire region along with maps of estimated standard error. Results indicate that at 300m by 300m pixel resolution, the spatial trends of predicted plot-level height are similar between field measurements and LiDAR measurements. The distribution of predicted stand height is very similar to the distribution of predicted LiDAR mean height with mean difference of only 0.28m. The mean of predicted plot tree height is comparable to the mean of predicted LiDAR 90th percentile height, but the distribution of predicted LiDAR 90th percentile height has much heavier tails.},

Abstract:
On shortleaf pines in Arkansas, newly installed dendrometer bands understated growth until the average tree had gained 0.15 inch in diameter. With a vernier diameter tape, two-season growth was measured to ±0.03 inch on 19 out of 20 trees, and the average difference between the tape and checkbands was only 0.003 inch.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to predict a model for describing stand structure of tree heights (h) and diameters at breast height (dbh). The research material consisted of data collected from 64 stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and 91 stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) located in southern Finland. Both stand types contained birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescent Ehrh.) admixtures. The traditional univariate approach (Model I) of using the dbh distribution (Johnson’s SB) together with a height curve (Näslund’s function) was compared against the bivariate approaches, Johnson’s SBB distribution (Model II) and Model Ie. In Model Ie within-dbh-class h-variation was included by transforming a normally distributed homogenous error of linearized Näslund’s function to concern real heights. Basal-area-weighted distributions were estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Species-specific prediction models were derived using linear regression analysis. The models were compared with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for marginal distributions, accuracy of stand variables and the dbh-h relationship of individual trees. The differences in the stand characteristics between the models were marginal. Model I gave a slightly better fit for spruce, but Model II was better for pine stands. The univariate Model I resulted in clearly too narrow marginal h-distribution for pine. It is recommended applying of a constrained ML method for reasonable dbh-h relationship instead of using a pure ML method when fitting the SBB model.},

The distribution parameters and the 24 and 93 percentiles for parameter recovery of a two-parameter Weibull were derived for empirical diameter and basal area distributions of 54 plots of 3740 m2 each. Regression analysis was used to relate the distribution parameters and percentiles to various canopy height and canopy density metrics derived from airborne laser scanner data over young and mature coniferous forest. On average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 1.0 m on the ground. Aerial photo-interpretation was used to divide the plots into three strata according to age class and site quality. The stratum-specific regressions explained 20-93\% of the variability in the observed percentiles. Total plot volume predicted from the estimated distributions was used to assess the accuracy of the regressions. Cross-validation of the regressions revealed a bias of -4.8 to 2.7\% between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume when the predicted frequencies of the diameter and basal area distributions were scaled to ground-truth stem number (N) and basal area (G), respectively. The standard deviations (SD) of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume were 5.6-29.1\%. However, when the scaling variables (N and G) were predicted from the laser data, the bias of plot volume determined by cross-validation was -4.7 to 6.6\% and the SD was 11.4-24.2\%.},

The simple model developed, combined the irregular seed production of white spruce with a declining seedbed availability to estimate quadrat stocking (4-m2 plots). Results of simulation experiments indicated that the probability of achieving greater than 40\% stocking with white spruce by the 10th postharvest year was 0.63. This result was sensitive to initial postharvest seedbed conditions and the frequency of good to excellent seed years and nonspruce revegetation rates. Both the field data and simulation results indicate the prospects of obtaining adequate white spruce restocking after timber harvest by unassisted natural regeneration were poor. However, simulation results also indicate that seedbed management may increase the probabilities of regeneration success significantly.},

	abstract = {In a glasshouse experiment closely spaced plants were regularly sub-irrigated with nutrient solution and it was assumed that competition between individuals was for light. Interaction between neighbours is modelled as a spatial process in relation to differences in plant height. The influence one plant has on another is calculated  as the ratio of the angle ß between their apices, and an angle \{theta\} which represents the intensity of competition  in the population as a whole. When ß {\textless} \{theta\} suppression is considered to occur, i.e. tall plants suppress short plants but not vice versa, competition is one-sided. The status of each plant within the population is calculated by multiplication of its individual plant neighbour interaction terms where ß {\textless} \{theta\}. This need not be restricted to nearest neighbours. Plants with status = 1 are free from competition, those with status = 0 are totally suppressed.

It is acknowledged that other processes than that modelled as competition may result in variation in relative growth rates. To account for this plant status is used to modify a relative growth rate drawn from a population of mean µ and standard deviation \{sigma\}. Plants for which status µ is less than an estimated \{phi\} are considered to die. Parameter values were estimated for a sequence of fortnightly harvests of glasshouse grown Tagetes patula. There was a decrease in µ and \{theta\}, \{phi\} increased and plants came to compete with their second nearest neighbours as well as their nearest as the community developed. The greatest \{sigma\} was at an intermediate stage, suggesting that more frequent assessments of the competition process are required at some stages than at others. Model parameters fitted to one data set were used in a Monte Carlo testing procedure with a second, independent data set. The importance of this technique is stressed because plants in a single community are not independent realization of the competition process. Simulations with the model reproduced both bimodality in the frequency distributions of plant size and an even spatial distribution of large or surviving plants, features which have been observed in a range of plant monocultures. To achieve these features it was essential that plant interaction be modelled as a one-sided process.},

	abstract = {Stand growth modelling based on single tree responses to their surroundings requires a description of the spatial structure of a stand. While such detailed information is rarely available from field measurements, a method to create it from more general stand variables is needed.
   A marked Gibbs point potential theory combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random process was used to create a spatial confi guration for any given number of trees. The trees are considered as charges rejecting each other and building ‘potential energy’. As an analogue of the potential energy in physical systems, the potential of a stand is defi ned in terms of size-dependent tree-to-tree interactions that can be thought of as related to resource depletion and competition. The idea that bigger trees induce larger potentials brings 3-dimensional effects into the system. Any feasible spatial structure is a state of the system, and the related potential can be calculated. The probability that a certain state occurs is assumed to be a decreasing function of its potential. Because more regular structures have lower potentials, by adjusting the steepness of the probability distribution the spatial structure can be allowed to have a lot of randomness (naturally regenerated stands) or forced to be very regular (planted stands). The MCMC algorithm is a numerical method of finding stand confi gurations that correspond to the expected level of the potential, given the size distribution of trees and the shape of the probability density function.
  The method also allows us to take into account spatial variation in the terrain. Some spots can be defi ned to have lower basic potential than others (ditch, planting furrow, etc.) in order to create areas of higher than average stocking density. A preliminary test of the method was conducted on two measured stands. The results suggest that the method could provide an effi cient and fl exible means of mimicking variable stand structures.},

	abstract = {The R package spatstat provides a very flexible and useful framework for analysing spatial point patterns. A fundamental feature is a procedure for fitting spatial point process models depending on covariates. However, in practice one often faces incomplete observation of the covariates and this leads to parameter estimation error which is difficult to quantify. In this paper, we introduce a Monte Carlo version of the estimating function used in spatstat for fitting inhomogeneous Poisson processes and certain inhomogeneous cluster processes. For this modified estimating function, it is feasible to obtain the asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimators in the case of incomplete covariate information. This allows a study of the loss of efficiency due to the missing covariate data.},

	abstract = {Design-based estimators of the sampling variance for apparent (S0 ⬚ observed) and predicted species richness (S˜ ) have been lacking. A balanced repeated replication (BRR) estimator is proposed and recommended for S0 andS˜ . Good performance of the estimators is demonstrated in two contrasting examples with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of simple random sampling with fixed area quadrats (plots) for estimating forest tree species richness. Chao and Lee’s estimator of species richness was used forS˜. In BRR a set of half-samples forming an orthogonal design with respect to the inclusion/exclusion of sample records is used to produce estimates of S0 and S˜ from the observed half-sample and models for the effect of data-splitting. BRR estimates of the sampling variance of S0 were close to the MC estimates in the examples from eastern Canada (PROV) and the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and clearly superior to naive model-based estimates. BRR estimates of S˜ were generally close to their MC counterparts, but in BCI a bias of approximately ⬚10\% was seen in small samples (n ⬚ 24). BRR estimates of sampling variance of S˜ in PROV were close to the MC estimates for n ⬚ 60. With larger sample sizes the BRR estimates drifted toward values obtained with Chao and Lee’s model-based variance estimator. In BCI the opposite was true.},

Testing focused on height measurement, but also considered distance and remote diameter measurements. Both laser instruments gave very precise estimates, but showed some bias. Users of these and other ‘high-tech’ instruments are reminded that precision is not synonymous with accuracy. Users should not become complacent about the submillimetre readout, but should calibrate instruments to examine if users' accuracy requirements are satisfied. Instruments may need to be re-calibrated each measurement season and after any mishandling.},
